## Welcome to the Chaos

Have you ever watched those movies? You know, *those* movies: people desperately trying to survive against an overwhelming sinister force, all the while trying to keep themselves from becoming part of that very same evil? Zombies, slashers, mind-controlling aliens, those kinds of movies. What about those really psychological survival-horror video games that have been so popular in the last few years? Evil spirits taking over a distant town, crazed maddened ghosts sucking the life forces out of everything they touch, murderous monsters of twisted and infectious designs – games like that. And the comics, oh man, the comics! I can’t go to the comic store today without seeing at least a half-dozen or more fantastic “Us Against The Zombies” serials, and it seems like there’s a brand new one on the shelf every month or so.

This game is about playing out the exact types of conflicts present in those movies, video games, comics and more. Characters will be created and thrown into a world which is soon to be flipped turned upside-down, if not already. Zombies, cannibals, infecting aliens, mind-controlling vampires, body-stealers, soul-eating parasites and more, there will be constant threats of vile monsters which seek to do horrible things to the characters, and the players get to role-play that chaotic action and survival. Perhaps they’ll be constantly running from the ever-impending evil. Perhaps they’ll be knee-deep in the blood and bodies of the creatures they ruthlessly slaughter. Perhaps they’ll murder each other over who gets the last candy bar. Perhaps they’ll buckle under the stress of survival and succumb to their inner madness. Perhaps they’ll even transform into the very monsters they fight, and turn hungrily upon those who were so very recently their friends and allies.

In ***Cannibal Contagion***, there can be plenty of high-adrenaline, off-the-hook combat. You (read: the Players) can take control of the game and seriously throw down. Blood can splatter the walls as you carve through the monster hordes in what I like to call a “Survival Comedy” style of game. But there can also be plenty of drama as the characters come face-to-face with the dark things that mere humans were not meant to face. As you see your friends and everything else about the world you knew destroyed and corrupted, you are forced to make some serious choices about your own morals and mortality. There is more than one way to succumb to the evil; Infection is one such way, definitely. But how different from that supernatural contagion is the sheer primal madness within all people, the instinct that rears its head when the human is forced to survive?

Thanks so very much for picking up a copy of ***Cannibal Contagion***. May your future days be full of desperation, and may your zombie-huntings be bountiful and maddening.

### What Makes This Game Different?

If you’ve ever looked through the shelves of your favorite local gaming store, I’m pretty sure you’ve noticed at least a couple of other games that already tackle the “Us Against the Undead” shtick. You may find yourself wondering what makes this game different from those other games. Perhaps thoughts such as “Man, *another* Zombie game? C’mon, bro, try something new!” have crossed your mind while looking through the book up until this point. But have no fear, this game brings something new to the table, and I’m here to tell you what that is: ***Cannibal Contagion*** is actually a role-playing game *about* Zombie survival, and not just a default role-playing game system with some Zombie monsters tacked on top. Those other games are lots of fun and several of them grace my shelves at home, but I never quite felt that they successfully brought the Zombie and the RPG together as one – as such, this game was written to fix that.

In ***Cannibal Contagion***, the mechanics are built entirely around the concept of survival against the dangers of an infectious enemy. Zombies are of course one of the most popular versions of that danger, but aliens, parasites, spirits, vampires, wendigo, and fundamentalist religious cults could all be effectively handled with the exact same approach: mechanics which could very quickly turn You into one of *Them*. How are Body Snatchers, Zombies, and Possessing Spirits really all that different? In this game, the abstract Infection rules are incorporated tightly into the core system, making the true threat of the Undead – that you might become one of them! – part of almost every conflict in which the characters participate.

### Reading This Text

This book contains all the rules you need to play this game. Throughout the text you will see various terms written in **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bold Smallcaps</span>**. This format is used to denote special mechanical terms that are important for understanding this game. All of these terms will also be listed and defined in the Glossary appendix at the back of this book.

Additionally, you’ll see words written in **bold** and *italics* quite frequently, and sometimes even both at once. These exist not as special terms or anything, but instead because I’m a pretty intense guy, and I get excited when I write and want to emphasize things.

Something I find more amusing than I really should is reading these rules to myself as if they were spoken by the Movie Trailer Guy. That guy is awesome, and I want his job very badly.

## Game Play Synopsis

***Cannibal Contagion (CC)*** is intended to be a fast-paced role-playing game of comedic gun-fu zombie-slaughtering survival and action. The game is overseen by one player, called the **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cannibal in Charge</span>** (CiC). The CiC sets the game premise, and the players make their first characters – we call these main characters the **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Survivors</span>**. Each player chooses their Survivor’s numbers, abilities, and personal details, and the CiC then sets the stage and frames the first Scene.

The game flows mainly in **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Scenes</span>**. A scene is set, and the play begins. Players role-play in the scene, narrating their own involvement until there is a conflict of some kind between the players and/or their characters, or between one or more players and the CiC. This most likely comes from one player disagreeing with aspects and details of another player’s chosen narration. When this happens, it’s time to break into a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Showdown</span>**.

In a Showdown, players draw cards from the deck and then play those cards against one another to determine success, and these Showdowns can frequently escalate into higher levels of intensity. Whoever wins the Showdown gets to narrate the outcome, and if the Showdown is combat-based, there may be additional effects caused by whatever weapons and equipment they are using.

Showdowns are where the shit hits the fan, and where the majority of the crazy zombie-fighting action takes place. In most Showdowns, the Survivors will face off against **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Threats</span>**, and attempt to overcome them with clever application of narration and mechanics. Of course, Showdowns don’t always have to involve zombies, especially should the Survivors decide to start whacking each other over personal slights and disagreements in plans. Nor do they even have to involve combat, and can be used to play out highly plot-sensitive actions and events that affect the game setting. But, just between you and me, there will quite likely be a lot of murdering in these. It’s one of the game’s big features, so just go at it and have fun.

The game flows in these scenes and Showdowns, and the characters push forward towards whatever goals and objectives they have established. For many games, the objective will most likely just be survival - getting the hell out of, well, Hell or wherever they are, should be a primary concern. But maybe there’s a bomb to diffuse, a crazy wizard to stop, an evil machine to destroy, a group of innocents to rescue, a sinister portal to seal, or something far more distressing. Perhaps the characters have goals that conflict, and their pursuit of these goals leads them to fight one another.

Between the scenes, the players can use special **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Survival Tokens</span>** to restore any damage their characters may have taken, repair their wounded psyches, and even acquire new equipment during the between-scene “downtimes.” Survival Tokens can also be used mid-scene to resist damage and insanity, and keep weapons loaded and primed for action.

The characters will come up against horrific things in this game, and sometimes the worst threats to their survival will be their own fragile minds. Monsters and demons are scary things, things humans weren’t meant to encounter or understand. In the face of such stress, the characters can risk their own sanity to push themselves further to the limit, doing greater things that they would not normally be able to accomplish in normal, “less-interesting” times. This is handled on-the-fly by meta-game negotiations between the player and their designated **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mad Half</span>** (another player at the table who controls that character’s insanity). As such, the characters are at an increasing risk of flipping out and doing psychotic wacko things.

All the while, as they try to stay cool and keep surviving, and their players narrate the story forward, the threat of Infection grows ever more serious. Many of the Threats the characters will face can infect them with the Contagion, and with just a little bit of time and a few wrong moves, any character could turn into a cannibal zombie-monster and turn against the others. Even more distressing is the knowledge that death will likely only hasten this inevitable threat.

Should a character ever turn to the Zombie Side, the player can choose to continue as that murderous evil or instead draw up a brand new character and keep fighting the good fight. The game could quite possibly change its focus drastically, with all the players in the roles of a pack of intelligent cannibal-monsters, hunting down other survivors to fill their insatiable hungers!

## Basic Session Flow

A typical game of ***CC*** flows a little something like this:

1. Game Setup: CiC lays out the scenario basics, prepares the materials
2. Character Creation: All the players create their characters and choose their Mad Half
3. Cold Opens: The CiC guides each character individually through their own custom introduction scene.
4. Scenes: CiC sets the scene, the players play through the scene until it’s time to move to a new scene.
5. Showdowns: When players conflict with Threats and each other, they use their cards to play through Showdowns and Quickies. Players can Negotiate with their Mad Half for on-the-fly empowerments during these card plays.
6. Scenes flow back-to-back until the game comes to a suitable end.

## The Pitch: Getting Your Players Interested

“Hey guys! Have you seen *Dawn of the Dead*? What about *Versus*, or *Wild Zero*? *Planet Terror*? Hell yeah, this game is just like that. Let’s do it!” It really is just that easy. Tell your players you have a zombie-survival game that only takes a couple of hours to play. Tell them it works even better with beer. They’ll see your logic, and soon you will all be playing a fabulous game of ***Cannibal Contagion***. Make sure the players understand the implied lethality of the game, so they don’t get all butt-hurt if (and more likely *when*) their characters die. Make sure they also understand that this game favors players who grab the story and push forward on their own. Players: Don’t turtle up! Seize the moment!

## Setting It All Up

To start a game of ***CC***, someone has to first take on the mantle of the Cannibal in Charge (CiC) and then gather together some friends to play. As the CiC, you should take some time beforehand to set up a scenario. The game’s scenario sets the basics of what is happening in the game, and the handful of mechanical variables that should be considered during playtime. A few example scenarios have been included in this book, each complete with sample characters and suggested game variables. Grab one of these and go if you want to jump right in, or create your own to fit your needs. Read the Scenario Creation section for more information on that (see page 117).

You’ll need to make sure you have the right materials to play, as well. Paper and pencils are always necessary. Of course, you can print up some character sheets, but I’ve personally found that scrap paper and index cards can be quite useful for character info, and are often more easily available for quick pick-up games. You’ll need a single deck of playing cards, with the jokers left in. You’ll also need a good number of tokens of some kind, for use as Adversity tokens and Survival tokens. Pennies, poker chips, and glass bead counters work very well for this, and you don’t even really need to differentiate between them.

If you’ve got the time and the inclination, consider printing out some of the optional accessory cards from our website. These can make it a lot easier for you to keep up with Weapons, Threats, Allies, and Mojo. There’s a nifty “Team Psycho” meter you can print up, too. Just lay it out on the table and have each player place a unique token of some sort on it to represent their character’s current stage of Madness.

## Using The Cards

All mechanical conflicts in ***CC*** are resolved using a standard deck of 54 playing cards with the Jokers intact. The ranking of suits, from highest to lowest, is Spades, Hearts, Clubs, and Diamonds (remember: Black, Red, Black, Red). Aces are high, and ranked at 14, with Kings, Queens, and Jacks ranked at 13, 12, and 11, respectively.

The two Jokers are the real game-winners. When a Joker is played, the player of the joker instantly wins whatever Showdown is in progress, unless the opponent instantly counters with the other Joker (at which point both of them are immediately canceled out). Jokers in the final Play Pile are considered “faces and aces” for all such purposes, in which cases each Joker qualifies as *two* such cards.

Throughout the game, the cards will be in one of four places: the Deck, the Discard Pile, the Play Pile, and the players’ Hands. At the beginning of every Showdown, involved players are dealt a Hand with a number of cards equal to their relevant Characteristic rank. As the Showdown is played through, the players play cards from their hands into the play pile. At the end of the Showdown, the cards from the play pile are counted to determine the results, and then placed in the discard pile. The core deck of cards will most likely be played completely through many times during the course of a high-octane game session.

The discard pile is ***only*** to be shuffled back into the deck when there are not enough cards left in the deck to play a Showdown. One of the subtler purposes of the deck is to maintain a level of mechanical tension. As the deck steadily runs out, the players are forced to enter conflicts knowing that their chances of drawing good cards become increasingly slimmer, and that can definitely affect their decisions. This is an intended feature of the mechanics, and it can easily be ruined by unnecessarily frequent reshufflings.

What if the cards run out and all of them are in hands, ready to play? Then stop drawing and start playing, folks!

### Optional: Using a Second Deck

Besides drawing cards for conflicts, you will find many instances where the game rules suggest you draw a card to just randomly see what happens. The CiC might use the deck to randomly create a quick Threat, or draw a card to determine the stats on a new weapon, or even just to get a quick descriptive count of how many zombies are shambling toward the players. The default rules assume you are making these draws from the main play deck, and helping it move along quicker, but if you want you might find it easier to have a second deck on-hand for the CiC to use just for these purposes. However, if you do choose to use a second deck to help with game management, all Quickies and Showdowns must be drawn from the same deck for all participants, including the CiC.

## A Note on Power Balances

As a player, you should keep in mind that the CiC is pretty much there to “get” you and make your character’s life dangerous and exciting. While there are definitely some checks and balances governing the CiC’s ability to directly screw with your characters, she still has a lot of discretionary power when it comes to throwing all kinds of dangers and blood-crusted plot hooks at you. The CiC can drive both you and your character crazy; the crazier she makes you, the more effectively she is doing her job.

## Challenge the Narration!

This game works best if the players take the narration and run with it. The CiC’s entire purpose in this game is to screw with the Survivors in as many ways as possible. The players must rise to the occasion and challenge the CiC, and fight for their own survival. If the CiC says your character’s head gets crushed by a boulder and you die, then it happens – *unless*, of course, you decide to say “hell no!” and challenge it, lettings the cards decide. If you believe your character can make a difference, then challenge the established narration and make her shine!

## Every Game is Different!

Keep in mind that every session of ***Cannibal Contagion*** will play out differently. Depending on how the players use the mechanics, your game may focus heavily on Contagion, Madness, Survival, or any combination of these or other core game themes and features. I’ve played games wherein the players descended into Madness within a tiny handful of scenes, yet didn’t really deal much with Contagion. Thene again, I’ve played games wherein the entire team of Survivors was Turned into zombies before anyone could even descend pas the second stage of Madness. I encourage you each to explore the themes of the heaviest interest to you, and let your own games flow as they may.

## About This Book...

I’m really hoping that I’ve made this rules text both an informative and enjoyable read. Don’t let its size intimidate you: there is more to this book than just rules! I’ve tried to space a whole mess of idea-inducing colorful text and reference material in here, and I hope you find reading it as enjoyable and inspiring as I found writing it to be.

## The Will to Survive

As a player, your character is your number one ultimate key to surviving a game of ***Cannibal Contagion***. When the game begins, you and your fellow players will create your very own characters together, and when that is done with, you’ll use your character to play the game and push the story and action forward. It is through your character that parts of the setting are explored, changed, destroyed, and even created. Each time you state the actions your character takes, you directly alter the course of the game and the story you all tell together.

In ***Cannibal Contagion***, you are given a whole lot of freedom in your character’s choices. Your character can do anything you want her to do, within the acceptable limits of the situation and game setting. For example, if your “scared schoolteacher” character is cornered alone by a horrible monster in the ruins of an old tenement, it would make sense for you to be able to say she grabs a brick from the rubble and uses it to smash the creature’s face in. However, it would not make any sense at all for her to sprout butt-wings, rise into the air, and spew forth blasts of holy flame from between the gaps in her teeth – unless of course that ability had somehow been previously established as a part of that character.

At the core of your character is a base Concept, in the form of a single question: Who Am I? Answering this question is a vital part of the game. The tone and wording of your Concept will drastically change your own perception of her attitude and feel, as well as the perceptions your fellow players and CiC have of her role in the game. Characters with funny names and story roles will have quite different impacts on the feel of the game. For example, a character whose base concept is “I am Zuhei Morocco, burger-flipper and the greatest Disco Samurai on the planet,” will have quite a different thematic impact upon the story than a character whose concept is “I am Carla Tomlinson, disgruntled waitress, a mother who needs to find her missing kids in this chaotic desolation of a city.” When coming up with your own core concept, heavily consider the implied themes that you, your fellows, and the CiC wish to evoke with this game.

## Character Creation

During the initial setup of the game, the involved players will need to make some characters before they can jump into the game. This process can be pretty damn quick if you’ve got a group of players with descriptive imaginations.

### Step Zero: The Scenario

Before the act of creation, you should talk with the CiC about the scenario he’s got planned. If he hasn’t planned one already, you should work with him to set one up. The CiC section of the rules has extensive details on how to create a game scenario, and player input can definitely help make the scenario awesome. Knowing the details of the scenario is pretty crucial to creating characters which will fit into the session’s events.

### Method \#1: Custom Characters

#### Premise, Concept, and Archetypes

If the CiC has not already set a premise for who the characters are, the player should discuss what their connection is, if any. Are they special forces agents on the same team? High school kids on a field trip gone bad? The Emperor’s personal samurai guardsmen? Completely unrelated strangers from all over the world?

Once a general connection and scale is established (if any), each character should be given a one-or-two-word Archetype label. This archetype will quickly define the role their character plays in the story at hand. Again, just make up something fitting, and it should fit closely with the concept. It’s a good idea to get inspiration from kung-fu and zombie action movies, which are chock full of these stock archetypes. The Archetype is primarily here for descriptive purposes, giving the players ideas on how to best role-play the characters they have created.

Here are some example Archetypes:

* The Yuppie Playboy
* The Pregnant Lady
* The Grizzled Cop
* The Awkward Nerd
* The Knife-Wielding Asshole
* The Gun Bunny
* The Girl Who Won’t Stop Screaming
* The Katana Mall Ninja Guy

Now, each player should take that basic Archetype and build upon it to come up with a quick statement of who their character is (aka, a character Concept). Some examples:

* I am Carla Tomlinson, disgruntled waitress, a mother who needs to find her missing kids in this chaotic desolation of a city.
* I am Roger Devries, focused businessman and skilled climber of the corporate ladder.
* I am Jian, the Japanese pretty-boy badass, and I’ve got a bone to pick with a shadowy figure from my dark past.
* I am Mei Li, an exchange student from China, and little do they know, but I’ve seen this happen before, and we’re all doomed.

If you read the first few paragraphs of this chapter, you know how important a concept is to the game. When creating a concept for your own character, it might be helpful to just think of a character from a movie or comic and use them as inspiration. I’ve encountered players who find that picturing what actor would play this character helps, too.

#### Goals

Every character in a game of ***Cannibal Contagion*** should have at least two major goals. The first goal is the Scenario Purpose, which is predetermined by the CiC. During character creation, the CiC will define the basic purpose of the scenario, and you should use it when creating the rest of your character. This Purpose sets a basic overall goal for all the players. It will likely be something simple, such as “escape the island” or “destroy the source of dark power” or some other such easily-stated goal.

The second goal is the Character Goal, which you should pick now. This is a special motivating desire that drives your character, a personal agenda that you should follow (and if applicable, try and accomplish) during this scenario. You could be searching for your missing kids, or trying to find a woman to start a new family with. Maybe you’re trying to stockpile as many weapons as possible, or locate as many other survivors of the apocalypse as you can. This can be as simple as a focused mindset (“I must protect these people!”) or as complex as you like (“I must get The Brown-Paper Package to Dock 23 before the stroke of 21:00 hours on the fourth day, or all is doomed!”).

As the game is played, you should try and focus on your character’s objective personally, while working with the other players to accomplish the scenario goal. Since each Survivor will have their own personal goal, it can be really fun to try and make them clash. This could lead to some great moments of in-game awesomeness!

#### Characteristics

After you have the concept, it’s time to determine your character’s **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Characteristic</span>** scores. This part should move pretty quickly, as it is simply a matter of assigning some numbers. Every character has four major Characteristics:

**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kill</span>:** This *active* Characteristic is used to win Showdowns through force and action, and usually by being totally badass. Mechanically, **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kill</span>** will most often come into play when trying to cause direct pain and suffering – usually through creative applications of weapons and fists – but it can also be called upon in Quickies when taking direct action to change the scene somehow. *You should boost **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kill</span>** if you want to be good at combat and direct action.*

**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>:** This *active* Characteristic is used to win Showdowns through brains, by being resourceful and seeing the Big Picture. Your **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** score will frequently be used for most non-combative attempts (improvised Quickies) to influence the setting, as well as for making Juice checks when your weapons run low on ammo. *You should boost **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** if you want to succeed on lots of out-of-combat Quickies, keep your weapons loaded, and carry lots of Gear.*

**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>:** This *passive* Characteristic is used to keep yourself alive. Your **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** score will come into play should you ever choose to attempt to resist incoming Hurtin’ and Infection, and it gives you more Survival tokens at the beginning of each scene. *You should boost **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** if you want to stay alive.*

**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cool</span>:** This *passive* Characteristic is used primarily to set the number of points you have in each of the five stages of your character’s Crazy-Go-Psycho meter. With a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cool</span>** rank of four, for example, you will have four points per each stage of your CGP meter, for a total of 20 points on the whole meter. *You should boost **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cool</span>** if you want to stay sane.*

At creation, you should rank these scores of 4, 3, 2, and 1 as you see fit. The easiest way is to just order them in a list in the way you see more appropriate to your character, and then rank them 4, 3, 2, and 1 right down the line. Below are some general guidelines on how these ranks relate to your character’s actual abilities.

**Rank 0:** Your character is Limited to the Whims of Fate. With Rank Zero, chances are your character has taken damage and might be approaching death. You can’t evoke this Characteristic, and in related Quickies and Showdowns you must resort to Negotiating with your Mad Half if you wish to participate. For more information on Negotiating, see page 91.

* **Rank 1:** Your character is capable of actively influencing the world to a mild degree by resorting to this Characteristic.
* **Rank 2:** Your character is fairly adept at getting her way using the relevant Characteristic.
* **Rank 3:** Your character rarely fails in her intentions when this Characteristic comes into play.
* **Ranks 4+:** Your character is nigh unstoppable when exerting this Characteristic, and practically always accomplishes her goals.

#### Gear and Weapons

Does your character have any useful **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gear</span>**? Think of some things your character might have in his possession that he might somehow find useful. These can be personal items, tools, survival gear, soda cans, gas cans, bubblegum and just about anything you can possibly think of. Run these by the CiC first, and if she approves, write them down on your sheet. You can start with a number of items equal to your **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** rank.

Don’t forget to keep track of those Gear slots! Every character has a limited number of slots, and each piece of Gear uses a slot. Hand-held things like Pistols, Lighters, Walkie-Talkies and anything smaller take up one slot, shotguns and rusty pipes and shovels take up two slots, bazookas take up three, and so on. Some items like sidepacks and backpacks and survival vests don’t take slots, and instead give additional bonus slots – one from a fanny pack, three from a backpack, etc.

Gear doesn’t have to be just “items,” either. You can get creative with your Gear, and have things like “Nice Rack” and “Thighs That Kill at 40 Paces” and “Winning Smile.” Each of these would still take up a slot, but the CiC or an opposing player would have to be *really* creative should they ever try and take them away from your character.

Keep in mind, though, that no matter how creative it is, the Gear has to be a thing you can _actively and directly_ apply to a situation in order to be mechanically legal.

If you so desire, you can choose to voluntarily decline any or all of your starting Gear. For each piece you don’t take, you give yourself one bonus Survival Token at the actual start of the game.

For more information on Gear, see page 65.

#### Advanced Rule: Allies

If your group consists of seasoned ***Cannibal Contagion*** players, your CiC may allow you to start the game with Allies. You must sacrifice Gear in order to do this. Each **two** pieces of Gear that you choose not to take can buy you one Rank of an Ally. Players can combine their ranks in order to purchase Allies, but no Ally Rank can exceed 4. Ask your CiC before assuming this is an option for you!

#### Mojo

Next, draw a random card to determine your character’s **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mojo</span>** power. This is a special boost that serves to give your character some kind of edge. The scope and apparent usefulness of the powers included in this book vary widely, so don’t be surprised if yours seems really amazing or really crappy. Write your Mojo power down on your character sheet.

#### Mad Half, Psychotrigger, and the CGP Meter

After all of the characters have been created, every player must choose another player at the table to play their **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mad Half</span>**. The Mad Half is responsible for handling all of your Negotiations when you want to push your character beyond her normal abilities. As the game flows, this player will very likely gain an increased level of control over your character’s actions and sanity. I suggest picking a player who is known for crazy wild exposition, as they will have the most fun with your character’s madness, and in turn everyone else will have a lot of fun being there when it happens. Every character must have a Mad Half, and no single player can be the Mad Half for more than one other player; each player must choose a *different* Mad Half for their character.

Once you have your Mad Half, it’s time to designate your character’s Psychotrigger. This is a simple statement of what it is that drives your character crazy in this game. It can be just about anything, from an addiction to an obsession, to a driving goal that is more important than anything or anyone else. This will be evoked by your Mad Half each time you want to Negotiate for empowerment.

Because the Psychotrigger will most likely be evoked quite frequently in the game, this needs to be something solid and evocable. When creating your Survivor’s Psychotrigger, you yourself need to be able to state aloud three or four ways that you can see it being narratively used against you. If you can’t think of such examples, then the Psychotrigger is probably not solid enough.

Below are some examples:

* Addicted to Cigarettes
* I must find my missing kids!
* Obsessive-compulsive inventory organization
* Problems trusting strangers

You can use the Quick-Draw table in the back of the book for more examples. Next, look at the Crazy-Go-Psycho meter on your character sheet and note that your **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cool</span>** rank +1 determines how many CGP points you can accrue for each stage of madness.

For more information on the Mad Half and Psychotriggers, see the Mad Half chapter starting on page 89.

#### Survival Tokens

Every Survivor begins the game with a number of Survival Tokens determined by their **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** Characteristic rank. Additionally, if they gave up any Gear options, they may have a few more points.

#### The Secret Votes

The final step of the creation process involves you answering each of the four Secret Votes. Either use some note paper or one of the special custom vote cards from the website, and fill in the name of the character you choose most likely to fill each of the answers. During the game, if any of these answers come true, you gain an immediate ***eight***-token bonus to your Survival token stash! The Questions are:

* Which character will die first?
* Which character will betray the others first?
* Which character will be turned by the Contagion first?
* Which character will reach Stage Five Madness first?

And for the record, yes, you can *totally* write yourself into any of these slots, if you think it will happen (or you think you can *make* it happen). When done, pass the cards/notes to the CiC, who will keep track of them and reward you when/if your vote succeeds.

### Method #2: Random Characters

If you don’t have a character concept in mind, or you just want to churn one out with a quickness, try using the second method for character creation. Grab a deck of cards and follow the steps below, and you should have a new character in just a couple of minutes, if not less.

For random Characteristics, draw four cards for each and lay them out in a row. These represent your four Characteristics from left to right (**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kill</span>**, **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cool</span>**, **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>**, and **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>**). The Characteristic with the highest card (determined by rank, then suit) gets a 4, the next a 3, and then a 2 and a 1. There ya go!

For random Archetypes and Psychotriggers, use the Draw Tables in the back of this book. For random Gear, empty your pockets onto the table, then survey the room you’re in (tabletop contents included) and pick four things that seem useful. Write them down. For the Mad Half, deal a card face-up to each other player at the table. The player with the highest card is your Mad Half. You can also use any of the steps in this system to supplement the Custom-Built creation method, replacing the steps you can’t figure out quickly on your own. You can even build a basic character profile by drawing cards against the quick Threat tables.

For a random name, check the Internet for a plethora of random name generators. There are some out there that can generate names from a variety of cultures past and present.

### Optional Stuff

Is your game using any optional rules, like Custom Weapons? Ask your CiC. If this session is using the Custom Weapons rule and the CiC allows it, then it is now time to draw for your character’s starting weapon. This is handled by drawing some cards from the deck and then comparing them to the table of weapons. If the CiC feels that certain weapons are a bit unlikely or disallowed for initial characters, she can remove the associated cards from the deck before shuffling and letting the players draw. Or, if she wants them all to have pre-set weapons, she can simply give them a weapon of her choice and move on from there. She is also perfectly within her rights to start you off with no weapons at all!

### Final Pieces

So, to re-cap, every character should have the following information:

* Name
* Archetype
* Concept
* 4 Characteristic Scores
* Useful Gear & Weapons
* Mojo Power
* Psychotrigger
* Crazy-Go-Psycho meter
* Place to write down the name of your Mad Half
* **Optional:** Additional handy cards for Pawn info, Token Costs, etc.

### Examples of Character Creation

#### Custom Method

> Vera, Karo, and Screg have gathered together to play a game of Cannibal Contagion, and Screg has volunteered to be the Cannibal-in-Charge – perhaps he has some kind of weird power trip, or maybe he’s just a masochist. Screg decides to use the default scenario from this book (The Zombie Apocalypse is Now), and lays out the basic premise of the characters’ connections in this session: “You’re completely unconnected people in downtown Atlanta during mid-day on a Friday.”
>  
> After a few minutes of discussion, Vera decides she wants to play a southern belle waitress named Carla. She writes down “I am Carla, tough but sweet greasy spoon waitress,” and next to her Archetype she decides to write down “The Sarah Connor.” She figures toughness and ass-kicking will be her biggest strengths, so she assigns Grit at 4 and Kill at 3, then puts Cool at 2 and Savvy at 1. As for Gear, she notes that she has a shotgun. Her Psychotrigger is “I want my kids back!” and Screg agrees that it can be frequently evoked.
>  
> Meanwhile, Karo works on his character, whose concept is “Roger, an arrogant yuppie with no redeemable qualities whatsoever.” For his Archetype, of course: “The Suit.” Karo figures Roger is best at being cool, so he ranks Cool at 4. He had to be resourceful to get this far in life, so Savvy is at 3. A few backs were stabbed along the way, so Kill is at 2, and since he’s a total wuss, Grit is at 1. For Gear, Karo writes down an Armani blazer, 500-dollar pen, and keys to a boat docked down on the ‘Hooch. He sets Roger’s Psychotrigger at “God Complex,” which could come into play quite frequently.

#### Using the Random Method

> Late to the table as usual, Splick shows up right before Screg wants to start, and he didn’t bring the required Pringles donation necessary for excuse of tardiness. Screg tells him he’ll have to use the random gen method if he wants to jump in, and Splick is cool with that (he’d better be if he wants to play). Splick grabs the deck and starts drawing, and after a minute he has written down that his character’s Archetype is “The Chainsaw Guy,” and he’s a Programmer with personal traits of “Too Much Coffee” and “Big Hairy Hands.” He then does a four-card spread to get his Characteristics. All he’s got left is Gear – he looks around the room and then writes down Wireless Mouse, Collectible Pen Set, Nerf Darts, and Raggedy Old Khaki Shorts. He writes down “Caffeinated Computer Programmer Gone Postal” as his concept. He loads up an online name generator and quickly gets “Max Benton” as his character’s new christening. For his Psychotrigger, he randomly draws “Something of a Pyromaniac,” which Splick finds hilarious.

## Mojo

Some gaming groups might feel that a bit of extra Oomph on the side of the characters could go a long way towards changing the flow and fun of the game for the better. Giving each character a unique empowerment of some kind can give the characters an edge above the rest, and really rock the game’s foundations. This can, of course, be good or bad, depending on your desires for the game. Mojo can drastically change the game’s balances, so CiC’s are encouraged to consider them before allowing them into the game.

Using the Mojo rules, every character gets one special Mojo power which somehow bends the rules to help them out. Most of these powers are ways in which certain rules just don’t apply to the character, or are always-on bonuses and enhancements. A few are special at-will powers the character can draw upon when needed. They are not really balanced in any way, but personally I think that’s what makes them fun.

Below are thirteen sample Mojo abilities. They’re numbered Two through Ace so you can randomly draw them if you like. Feel free to create your own!

* **2: Adaptability Under Fire:** Before any Quickie or Showdown, you can gain a point of CGP to permanently swap any two Characteristics’ current Ranks. This *does not* swap their starting maximums, though.
* **3: Always Keep One in the Chamber**: Whenever the standard rules say you run out of Juice with your weapon, you can gain a point of CGP and say you didn’t actually run out of Juice, and continue using your weapon as normal. Your actual Juice tally remains unaffected by this Mojo, however, so watch out for the next time you use your weapon again.
* **4: Balls of Steel**: In Showdowns and Quickies, you can gain a point of CGP to substitute your **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cool</span>** score for **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kill</span>** or **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>**. You must declare this before the cards are dealt.
* **5: By Will Alone:** In Showdowns and Quickies, you can gain a point of CGP to substitute your **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** score for **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kill</span>** or **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>**. You must declare this before the cards are dealt.
* **6: The Calming Repose of Death:** Each time you kill an opponent in a single Showdown with no assistance from your teammates, you can erase a point of CGP from your meter.
* **7: Carrier Immunity:** You are immune to the effects of the game’s Contagion, but you can still carry it. If you ever become infected, ignore any Effects, Threshold, and Aftermath of the Contagion. Once infected, you can transmit it through normal means.
* **8: Effing *Hard Core*:** You’re so hard core, you can sacrifice your own well-being just to hurt your opponents. When you win a combat Showdown against an opponent, you can voluntarily take any amount of direct Hurtin’ in order to deliver an equal amount of Hurtin’ to your opponent. You cannot attempt a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** check to resist any of your self-inflicted Hurtin’. Any Hurtin’ you apply to yourself is divvied among your Characteristics as you see fit.
* **9: Get Out of Hell Free Card**: Like a cat that’s used up seven of its lives, you’ve got two remaining. The first time anything in the game ever causes your death, you bite the bullet, but only for a short while. At the beginning of the next scene, you are back in the game with one rank in each of your Characteristics. Keep in mind, this does nothing about existing Infection or CGP, but it might just stave off that Turning for a little while longer.
* **10: My Kung-Fu Is Better Than Yours:** Once per opponent per session, you can evoke this Mojo to force your opponent to discard the last card they just played. You can only ever use this once on the same opponent, *ever*. Using this power gives you one point of CGP.
* **J: One Tough Sumbitch:** When making **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** Quickies to attempt to nullify incoming Hurtin’, each face or ace drawn nullifies two Hurtin’, instead of the usual one.
* **Q: Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Scene:** If you have been narrated into a scene, you can gain a CGP point and write yourself out of it at any moment before you *play* any cards. You must be able to narrate your departure somehow, such as how you vanished while no one was looking, or how contrary to what everyone believed, you were never there in the first place. Once you’ve played even a single card in this scene via Quickie or Showdown, you lose the ability to evoke this during this scene. Note that being *dealt* cards does not count as actually having played them.
* **K: Time Bomb**: You’ve got one last surprise for whoever kills you, one last trick up your sleeve should you ever have to bite that proverbial bullet. Whenever your character is killed in the game, everyone near her takes Hurtin.’ The Amount of Hurtin’ dealt is equal to your current stage of Madness multiplied by your **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cool</span>** rank, Divided among everyone present. You have to narrate the nature of this unexpected Hurtin’ – maybe it’s a bomb in your head, maybe it’s a particularly violent death spasm, or maybe even your blood is filled with highly corrosive poisons, it’s up to you.
* **A: Voice of Reason:** You are adept at calming those around you, reducing their madness in the face of dark times. You can “take” points of CGP from others, erasing one point from their current CGP tallies for each one you add to your own.
* **Joker:** Take your pick!

## The Question and the Cold Open

The very last step of character creation, be it the custom or random method, involves the CiC asking your character a question. Usually, this question will be some variant of “Where were you when the zombies attacked?” Once the CiC asks you, an intro scene with your character will be framed and played. This scene is called a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cold Open</span>**, and it is used to introduce your character to the events of the game. Typical games will feature each Survivor in her own unique scene, but if multiple players want to there is no reason they can’t share a Cold Open. Once each player has had their Cold Open, the game truly begins. More info on Cold Open scenes is found in the CiC’s section, on page 125.

# Part 3: The Rules

“In a world where the dead are returning to life,  
the word “trouble” loses much of its meaning.”

*Kaufman, from* Land of the Dead

## Surviving the Game

Most of the game will be handled through free-form role-playing. Players will state their intentions, explore the scenes together, and generally free-play on their own without need of too much guidance from the CiC. Sometimes, there might be an issue or question at hand, like “Do we find some hidden caches of grenades inside this dumpster?” or “Can I use this hypo-spray stuff to clean the Infected wound?” and such. In these moments, the CiC is free to make an instant call on it and just say “sure, that’s awesome” or “hell no, that’s retarded,” but she may also decide instead to leave it to chance and let the cards decide. This involves a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Quickie</span>** test.

Other times, one or more players may directly oppose the narration of another player at the table, or even the CiC. In such cases, the CiC can declare that the conflict requires them to take it to a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Showdown</span>**, and let their cards and Characteristics determine whose version of the story holds true.

### When to Use the Cards

In an ideal game, the CiC should never have to actually solicit the players to break out the cards. The CiC will set the Scene and narrate elements into it, the players will state their actions in the scene, and the CiC will narrate the outcomes of those actions how she sees fit. If ever a player feels her character should be able to affect the outcomes differently than the CiC’s narration, and that different outcome is important to her, then she can choose to evoke the card mechanics and try to adjust the situation to one more fitting her desires. Essentially, the CiC’s narration holds true until the players use the cards to alter it; **or in other words, the CiC is right until the players choose to try and make the cards say otherwise**.

Players, you are encouraged to use the cards often: Seize the Moment! If you want to affect the scene somehow, and the CiC narrates otherwise, then you should narrate a way for your character to take the initiative and change the world around her. If you say your character does something, and the CiC says that she fails, then you can call upon the cards to try and *not* fail. If the CiC says that something happens to your character, and you think it shouldn’t, then evoke the cards and see if she can change her fate. If the CiC says that falling rocks kill everyone, then it happens unless you bring the cards out and make them say otherwise.

Just be warned: don’t call on the cards unless you are prepared to narrate your potential success. There’re few things more irritating in a game than a player who is trigger-happy with the cards but can’t follow through with the story. If you’ve got any idea for something cool, then go for it! But if you’re just throwing cards down without foresight, I encourage you to put some imagination into your actions *before* resorting to the cards.

### When to Quickie, When to Showdown, and When to Move On

Okay, so now you’ve decided that your character is not going to accept the CiC’s decision for her fate. Which of the card Mechanics in the next section do you use? Well, if the situation is mostly one-sided, or of the “do I succeed or do I fail?” nature, then you call upon a Quickie to decide the results. However, if you are being directly opposed by another force in the game, of you are working against a Threat that the CiC has purchased into the game with her Adversity Tokens, then you use a Showdown. Quickies are meant to allow you to quickly decide an outcome and move on, while Showdowns are meant to be dramatic and important, and full of delicious smack-talking.

## Card Mechanic #1: The Quickie

Quickies are typically called upon in two different situations. The first is to allow the cards of fate to quickly make a decision on an unexpected in-game question. If the CiC feels that there’s a chance something random and unexpected might happen, such as a character hacking into a network and accessing the sprinklers in a building, or another character finding a hidden Glock under their neighbor’s mattress, she can allow the players to make Quickies to see what happens. In some ways, this can be seen as the general “skill check” of the ***CC*** rules.

The other situation most often arises when the players have to resist some in-game effect, such as Infectious zombie bites. In these cases, players are allowed to call upon certain Characteristics to resist these game effects. For example, by spending a Survival token, you can use **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** to reduce Hurtin’ received from combat-focused Showdowns.

In either situation, the mechanics are the same. When a Quickie is called upon, the CiC states the relevant Characteristic for the situation, and the player draws that many cards from the deck (I *highly* encourage CiCs to allow the players to draw their own cards, as it helps to connect them directly to the game mechnics). If any of them are faces or aces, the player wins; otherwise the Quickie is a failure. The CiC narrates the success and failure consequences of Quickies, but is free to allow the players to do so as well (forcing a player to narrate their own failure can lead to some really fun moments). In most cases, one ace or face denotes basic success, and additionals should encourage the player to add a bit more flair to the narration. If the purpose of the Quickie was to resist some incoming Hurtin’ or other such effect, each face or ace denotes one point resisted. Keep in mind that the draw of a Joker counts as *two* faces or aces. No narration is necessary for Quickies made to resist mechanical effects, but it doesn’t hurt, and can only make the scene cooler.

You can get additional card draws by evoking Gear and negotiating with your Mad Half for more. Evoking Gear is described on page 65, while the process of Mad Half negotiation is described on page 91. If a character has no ranks in the relevant Characteristic, they can only attempt a Quickie by evoking Gear and/or Negotiating with their Mad Half for more cards. Otherwise, the CiC’s narration holds.

> **Quickie Example #1:** Vera’s character Carla is in desperate need of some serious firepower after barely escaping from that pack of wild slime zombies with her life and sanity intact. She ducks into a locally-owned hardware store in search of something to use in a pinch. Screg (the CiC) says that the store has been looted almost entirely dry, and nothing of importance can be found. Vera believes that there might be a chance that something useful got left behind in the chaos of this morning’s riots. Screg says what the hell, and agrees to let her try a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** Quickie to see if anything might be scrounged up. Carla’s **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** score is 3, so Vera draws three cards: the 2 of Spades, the 10 of Clubs, and the Jack of Clubs. Because she succeeded at the Quickie with a Jack, Screg decrees that she manages to find a baseball bat, a box of shotgun shells, a hubcap for a 1972 Pinto hatchback, and a welder’s mask. The baseball bat is definitely useful as a weapon, and the shells could help her out on Juice checks should she ever find a shotgun. As for the other two, well, your ideas are as good as mine.

> **Quickie Example #2:** Karo’s character, Roger the Suit, is in a bad spot. He’s currently surrounded by a handful of contagious cannibals, and one of them just bit him! At the end of the conflict, Screg afflicted Roger with three points of Hurtin’ and two points of Infection. Karo elects to spend Survival Tokens to make **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** Quickies to attempt to resist some, if not all, of the incoming Hurtin’ and Infection. He spends one token to start the first Quickie, drawing two cards (his **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** rank): an Ace and a King! Woot! He resists two of the Hurtin’ (one for each face or ace drawn), and decides to take the third. He then spends another token to try a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** Quickie to resist the Infection, drawing a five and a nine. Oh no! It looks like Roger is now on the spiraling path to zombification!

### Optional Rule: Quickie Difficulty

In most situations, a simple face-or-ace success is satisfactory to win a Quickie. However, the CiC might feel that in some circumstances, the chances are a bit tighter. Kicking in a dead-bolted door might be doable with a simple **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kill</span>** quickie, sure, but getting past an electrified fence or a sealed security door at a military bunker might be a whole other realm of difficulty. For situations like this, the CiC can choose to evoke the two grades of tougher Quickie difficulties.

The first grade of increased difficulty is called the **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Royal Pain</span>**, and requires Queens and Kings. In order for the player to succeed, she must draw Kings and Queens – Jacks and Aces just won’t cut it. The second (and highest) grade of increased difficulty is called the **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Longshot</span>**, and requires Aces – so the player fails unless they have one or more Aces in their draw. So from the previous example, the dead-bolted door would be a normal Quickie, the electrified fence a Royal Pain Quickie, and the security door a Longshot. **In both situations, Jokers are wild**.

## Card Mechanic #2: The Showdown

Whenever any player’s choice of narration (and this includes the CiC) is directly contested by any other person at the table, a Showdown begins, and the mechanics of the game enter play. To initiate a Showdown, the contesting player must state “I challenge you!” At that point, the contested player can choose to commit or relent. If they relent, then the contesting player narrates the outcome instead, although of course than anyone can choose to counter-challenge that new narration. In any case, if players commit to a challenge, then the Showdown officially begins. **Once a Showdown begins, you are committed, and cannot relent until the cards are all played!**

A Showdown is a quick card battle played out between the contestants. Players go back and forth, playing higher cards and adding more dramatic smack-talking narration until one side wins. Chances are, the Showdown will most likely involve some bad-ass combat, with some crazy moments of bloody carnage. Don’t worry, this is intended!

### Showdown Flow

There are ten quick steps to each showdown. This may seem like a lot, but in truth each step is a quick moment or two of action or decision, and once you get the flow down you will notice your Showdowns flow by with a quickness (crazy narration considered, of course!).

#### Step 1: State Actions

Once a Showdown has been declared and accepted, both sides state their action. The player who initiated the challenge states their intended action first, telling everyone what they’re doing. The challenged player follows suit. The stated actions should, of course, obviously conflict.

When stating your action, you should focus on the actual action part of it, and not what you intend to accomplish with that action. Stating “I run across the room screaming at him, sword in hand” is acceptable, but stating “I run at him and cleave him in half with my sword, screaming maniacally as I eat his flesh” is not. Leave the outcome open to the interpretation of the winner.

#### Step 2: Draw Cards

Once the actions are fully stated, the CiC tells each side which of their Characteristics apply to their action. The CiC then deals each involved player a number of cards from the deck equal to their rank in that Characteristic. Do NOT look at them just yet!

If a participating player has no ranks in the relevant Characteristic, they can only participate by using Gear and/or Negotiating with their Mad Half (see below for details on both). Either side can boost their initial draws with Gear or Negotiation, but once the cards start being played, no more can be drawn. Again, there is no Hand limit, which means that it is entirely possible for characters to skate along (and win!) entirely on their own Gear and Crazy-go-Psycho.

#### Step 3: Gear and Allies

Once each involved player has their cards face-down in front of them, they can choose to evoke any of their Survivor’s (or Threat’s!) applicable Gear, provided they can narrate how their survivor is directly applying that Gear. You can choose to either Activate or Sacrifice your Gear in a Showdown, but you *can not* do both at once.

If you Activate, you can pick a piece of Gear and, narration permitting, evoke that Gear for a single bonus draw, pulled from the deck and added face-down with your other cards. For each rank in your **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** characteristic, you can choose to Activate another piece of Gear, with each one giving you another bonus draw, provided you can narrate the Gear’s applicability. Note that if you intend on applying a Custom Weapon’s Hurtin’ bonus to the outcome of this Showdown, you *can not* also Activate it for a bonus card at this point – you must decide which is more important: bonus cards or bonus Hurtin’.

If you instead choose to Sacrifice, you can pick a single item of your Gear list and destroy it for an immediate four-card bonus to your draw. Again, you must be able to acceptably narrate the sacrificing of the Gear.

Allies are special, and can be evoked regardless of how you choose to use your Gear. See the Allies section on page 76 for more information.

#### Step 4: Consider Your Hand

Now each player can pick up their cards and look at them. Take a quick moment to consider your strategy for this Showdown, and how effective your current hand of cards is for helping you achieve that.

#### Step 5: Negotiation

Do you feel that you need more cards? If so, you’re going to have to negotiate with your Mad Half for more. This involves you practically begging them for more cards. Should your Characteristics be low and your Gear be non-applicable, then you will *have* to do this if you want more cards, and a better chance of success.

Negotiating is a separate process described in the Mad Half section (see page 91). Note that if your character is already at Stage 5 on the Meter, then you *can not* Negotiate for more cards until you somehow raise your Madness stage back to a higher level.

#### Step 6: Play Cards

Once you have your final Hand ready to go, it’s time to play the cards. The initiating player starts by playing a card face-up on the table, and then the challenged player plays a higher one (by rank and then suit) face-up. The initiating player can then return by stating how they are “**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stepping it Up</span>**,” narrating how their action is being intensified, and then playing another card higher than the one their opponent just played. The challenger can then follow suit, if able. Stepping It Up is essentially a game of back-and-forth smack-talking, wherein each participant narrates a bit more oomph into their action.

When you step it up, your extra narration of each additional card you play is *crucial* to the flow. In order to play an additional card, you *must* Step It Up, and in order to Step It Up, you *must* be able to play a higher card than the last player’s. It makes these card battles all the more fun, and can get some really evocative smack-talking to happen.

#### Step 7: Determine Winner

Play continues back and forth like this, with each player stepping it up and playing another card, until one side cannot beat the other side’s played card. At this point, the Showdown is over, and the player with the last-played card has won. Any cards played remain in the Play Pile. Any cards left in the hands are discarded, face-up, into the Discard Pile.

#### Step 8: Apply the Results

Whichever player wins now gets to narrate the outcome of the Showdown. Their initially-stated action succeeds and all of their “Steppings” should be factored into this narration, and they can now use the cards played by both sides to add additional effects to the outcome.

The cards played by everyone during the Showdown are now used to determine the results of the conflict. Cont the played card: each card in the pile translates into a single point of **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hurtin’</span>** generated, which the winner can deal out to her opponents. Hurtin’ can be applied as damage in offensive Showdowns, but is otherwise useless in most other Showdowns. Different weapons and effects may drastically modify this damage output. Some weapons may do bonus damage, others may multiply it, and others have different effects altogether, so factor them in too. See Page 61 for the rules on using Hurtin’.

Additionally, if there are any Aces or Faces in the pile, the victor can choose to exchange them to either buy **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Facts</span>** or gain Survival Tokens. Cards thus exchanged take away from the Hurtin’ total, but they have their own special rewards. Remember: Jokers count as two such cards! Read below for the details.

##### Exchanging Cards for Facts

Each Fact purchased allows the character to add a little something extra to the scene’s current narration, above and beyond the success of their stated action. For example, if Carla just succeeded in diffusing a bomb that was about to kill everyone, she could then use a Fact to narrate how she was also able to completely recover the C4 and the blasting materials for later use. Here are some other examples:

* As I punch him, I grab his gun and wrench it from his grasp.
* Once I dive out the door, the building collapses behind me!
* After killing the zombies in the shower room, I find my kid brother hiding in a locker!
* After climbing the dangerous rubble, I run into another group of flesh-starved demons, OMG!

The player can pretty much narrate anything as a Fact provided it somehow fits within the scope, theme, and feel of the game and the scene at hand. There are some set limits, though:

**Players cannot narrate the death of another specific character**, *as long as that character has Characteristic scores or was paid for using Adversity tokens*. The deaths of these characters must be determined by weapons, dangers, and Hurtin’. However, if the character in question is only “background color” of the current scene (i.e., a “wallflower”), and has no Characteristics or Threat, he can be slain at will through narration. (“Sadly, while I carved through the monsters with ease, one of them managed to bite the head off of poor Wilson before I could kill it.”)

**You can narrate any kind of wound or hardship to be inflicted upon the losing opponent, and they must role-play it from then on.** However, it does not cause actual Hurtin’ or Characteristic damage unless the damage rules say so. But keep in mind: sure, if you cut their trigger hand off, they may still somehow have all their Characteristic ranks, but they won’t be able to use that gun anymore. (“My sword cleaves off his arm as well, and he stands there clutching it as blood spurts out like a fountain.”)

**If your narration includes something that the CiC decides directly affects the other characters, those other players must agree to it.** If they don’t, either re-phrase it or take it to another Showdown with the affected parties.

Otherwise, go to town. You are encouraged to go wild and crazy when narrating your Facts. Destroy the environment, blow things up, create histories that weren’t there before, and so on. If you want to narrate that a crushed VW Microbus crashes through the wall and breaks someone’s leg, go for it (although that would probably be two separate Facts, one for the bus and one for the broken leg). It is advisable to have the narration make sense within the context of the scenario, unless you all agree that it is going to be one of *those* kinds of games.

##### Exchanging Cards for Survival/Adversity Tokens

If the victor chooses to exchange face-or-ace cards for Survival Tokens, each *single* card thus exchanged gives him *one* bonus token. If the CiC wins, he can choose to exchange faces or aces to directly increase his Adversity Pool on a one-for-one basis.

#### Step 9: Check Juice Tallies

Once the results are applied, anyone who used a Juice-requiring Gear should compare the highest-played card to their Gear’s Juice Tally. If the card’s rank is greater than or equal to the tally, move on. But if it is less than the tally, the weapon has run out of Juice. See page 66 for more info on Juice.

#### Step 10: Cleanup.

Once the Showdown is resolved, all players put all the cards left in their hands and the Play Pile into the discard pile. The deck is *not* reshuffled unless the cards have run out. If either side used a Juice-requiring weapon, apply the Juice Mod first and then check to see if you’re out of Juice.

> **Showdown Example:** While exploring an abandoned subway station, Jian kicked in an office door to find a trio of diseased cannibals tearing apart the body of a policeman (Screg introduced them as a single entity, Hindrance Role, Threat 5). Hunter (Jian’s player) takes the initiative and announces that he is going to charge in and slice them to zombie shreds. Screg declares that this will require a Showdown.
> 
> Hunter has already stated his action, and Screg says it will require the Kill Characteristic (obviously), which Jian has at rank 3. For the cannibals’ action, he states “They lose all interest in the policeman’s corpse and lunge at you, their jaws a-slobberin’ with rottenness.” Screg deals three cards to Hunter, and since the cannibals are Hindrance-Role Threats, he deals himself three cards (Hindrance-role Threats always enter a Showdown with three cards). Hunter decides he wants one more card, so he first chooses to activate his sword as a piece of Gear, giving himself a bonus card to the draw. Since Screg is just using the standard “weapons as Gear” rule, he doesn’t have to worry about losing any particular Hurtin’ bonus.
> 
> Hunter still wants more cards, though, so he Negotiates with the Mad half to draw more cards. His Mad Half agrees to let him draw up to two cards, which he does, taking two points of CGP and marking them on his tally. Screg sticks with his three base cards. Both sides satisfied, the play begins.
> 
> Since Hunter started the Showdown, he plays the first card. He has an Ace of Diamonds in his hand, and he’s sure he’s going to win with it, so he decides to milk the bad guys for as many cards as he can in order to boost his outcome. He opens low, starting with a four of Diamonds. The CiC also has a pretty good card in his hand, so he plays along, following with the seven of Spades.
> 
> If the Showdown is to continue past this point, then Hunter and Screg are going to have to Step It Up. Hunter now plays the nine of Hearts, and states aloud “My sword is razor-sharp; once it enters the fray, there’s nothing can resist its edge.” Screg counters with the nine of Spades (which trumps the nine of Hearts), adding “The policeman just tasted awful to these guys, so their hunger is even more intense and it drives up their intensity to rip you to shreds.” Back to Hunter, who plays the Jack of Clubs, and says “Their intensity pales in comparison to the relentless will that drives my zombie-slaying survival instincts.” Screg again counters, playing the King of Spades and saying “That’s too bad, because your survival instincts fail when matched against their superior primal instincts.” Screg thinks he’s won, but now Hunter lays down that Ace of Diamonds, stating “Primal instincts be damned! With a whirl of wind and a flash of steel, their heads are removed and I stand victorious.”
> 
> Hunter came out victorious, so he counts the total number of cards in the Play Pile: Seven! Four of the cards in the pile are numerical, with two faces and an ace. Hunter applies five of them (the four numbers and the Jack) as points of Hurtin’ to the cannibals, in addition to whatever Hurtin’ bonus his sword might apply. Five is enough to eliminate their entire Threat score! Hunter takes the narrative reins as a result of his success and states “I charge into the room, leap and slide across the desk and land right on top of the cannibals. I stand in a dramatic pose and immediately start spinning with my sword, all chop-chop murderiffic action and such. In mere moments, their heads are flying into the air in a slow, almost synchronized dance of blood and gore, their hungers eternally quelled.” He then uses one of the two remaining face cards to add a Fact to the scene: “When the blood is settled, I notice a gun, a walkie-talkie, and a ring of keys on the dead cop’s belt.” He trades in the other remaining face card for a bonus Survival Token.
> 
> The five points of Hurtin’ completely eliminate the zombies as a viable Threat, and the additional Fact allowed Hunter to throw a weapon and some extra gear into the scene. Additionally, he was able to acquire a new Survival Token. Sweet!

### Who’s Next?

When the Showdown is resolved, anyone else can take actions of their own. Whoever states their response first, acts first, and is considered the “challenging” player for the new follow-up Showdown. Let everyone have a turn at the action before anyone takes a second or third go. It’s usually easiest to just go around the table in order of seating.

### Multi-Player Showdowns, or “Us Against Them”

The standard Showdown process makes it quite possible (and easy!) for multi-player Showdowns. Playing with three or more players follows the exact same rules, and can lead to some crazy Showdowns. If there is more than one character involved in an in-game conflict, be they working together or all against each other, the rules work the same.

When multiple players are participating in a Showdown, the play starts with the challenged player and moves along to their left. Everyone states their actions as normal, narrates their stepping-ups as normal, and resolves the outcome as normal. Players can choose to work together and strategize, but they ***can not*** show each other their cards. Once the cards start playing, however, there can be no more inter-player strategizing. Once participants start playing, again the flow goes around the table until no one can trump the last card played. You can’t skip a turn, either; once you can’t beat the last-played card, you can no longer affect the winning decision by playing any new cards.

Like any other Showdown, the winner narrates the outcome. If other players were helping the winner out, he can choose to consider their assistance in his choice of outcome narration, or even allow the assisting players to chime in for themselves. If, for example, he was assisted by another fellow combatant, she can include not only the effects of her weapon in the final Hurtin’ count, but their weapon as well. This makes multi-player Showdowns pretty ideal for resolving big multi-character combat scenes with just one or two hands. It can also make it pretty damn painful to get ganged-up on by a large number of opponents.

Hurtin’ and Facts are handled as per normal rules. If the winner of a combat-focused Showdown was against multiple players, she can choose to divvy out any of the Hurtin’ generated to her opponents as she sees fit (although the victims still get to pick which Characteristics take the hits). The winner can choose to use faces or aces to generate Facts and reduce CGP points, and dole them out to participants as she sees fit.

Note that if the CiC is controlling multiple Threats in the same Showdown, and they are working together, then their Hands are added together into one big Hand. Thus, two separate Hindrances give the CiC a hand of six cards, three for each Hindrance!

> **Multi-Player Showdown Example:** Jian (played by Hunter) has joined up with Carla (played by Vera), and they’ve been cornered by another pack of cannibals (Hindrance, Threat 10) in the sewers beneath New York. Once the cards have been dealt and the characters have Negotiated for bonus draws, Hunter has four in his hand, Vera has six, and Screg (the CiC) has four. Since the zombies initiated, Screg leads with a three of Diamonds, Hunter (to Screg’s left) plays a three of Hearts, Vera a three of Spades. They go around the circle once more stepping it up, and when it gets back to Screg, six cards have been played and he finished with an Ace of Spades. That’s a final play of seven cards, which he can choose to divide between Jian and Carla as he chooses. He sends four Hurtin’ at Jian and three at Carla, who then get to determine how it is applied.
> 
> Jian and Carla then decide to return the love, launching a counter offensive against the zombies. Another round of hands is dealt, and after three rounds of card-plays, Carla wins with the ninth card, a King of Clubs. That’s potentially nine points of Hurtin’ coming at those zombies! Nice!

### What Characteristic Do I Use?

If you wish to use violence, hurting, direct action, and force to overcome the conflict, use Kill. If you wish to approach the obstacle from unexpected angles, use the environment, assist your allies, hack the mainframe, or otherwise use guile, wit, resourcefulness and insight to overcome the conflict, use **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>**. Sometimes the situation is pretty obvious – usually, if your intention is to cause direct Hurtin’ to a person, place, or thing, then you use use **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kill</span>**, and if your intention is to bypass a conflict or challenge through less direct means, then you use **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>**.

### Showdown Strategies

The main strategic decision in a Showdown is when to play your highest card. Ask yourself the following question: “Do I want to win *Big*, or do I want to win *Now*?” You can play early and try to win ASAP, or save it and hope to win later and increase your outcome. However, if you hold off, you could make your opponent’s success all the more powerful. If you play high early and you fail, you’ve at least limited your opponent’s outcome. On the other hand, if you’re sure you have a nigh-unbeatable card, holding off on it until the last possible moment can backfire should your opponent actually beat it. The more cards played, the more potential Facts and Hurtin’ you can generate by winning.

Another strategy involves the effective management of your Crazy-Go-Psycho levels. By successfully Negotiating with your Mad Half, you can acquire points of CGP for the *chance* of one or more better cards to help you win the Showdown. By gaining a lot of CGP you can definitely work to increase your chances of success, but you can also limit your future effectiveness in the game as your sanity grows ever the more fragile. Sure, faces and aces in a winning hand can allow you to eliminate some of those CGP points, but in order for that to happen, not only must there be aces or faces in the play, but you’ve also got to win in the first place.

## Hurtin’: How to “Bring It”

If you win a Showdown and your narration involved dealing bodily harm to another character (or pack of zombies), then you can potentially deal damage to your opponent, based on the cards in the Play Pile and possibly what weapon you are currently using. Upon winning a Showdown with any cards in the Play Pile, you can choose to cause some hurt to your opponent.

In order to cause Hurtin’ to an opponent, your initial statement of action must have included an obvious statement of your intent to harm. If the CiC or the opponent do not agree that it did, and you want to use your results to hurt them, the only way to do so is to spend one of the aces or faces in the play pile to create a Fact that somehow turns the outcome into one of pain and suffering (for your opponent, at least). Doing so is the same as any Fact, and you must narrate how the original action was turned into an attack of some kind. This is most likely to happen when you are the defender in a Showdown, and your initial statement was merely to get the hell away.

The base damage of any attack-based action is determined by the Hurtin’ generated through that action’s Showdown. That base damage is then modified by the stats of the weapon or maneuver being used by the winner. The damage is immediately applied to the opponent as a direct and permanent reduction of their Characteristic scores. The opponent chooses how their scores are reduced. If the attack was against a Threat (such as a horde of cannibals), the damage directly reduces its Threat score. When a Survivor’s Characteristic ranks or a Threat’s score are completely eliminated, they are dead.

The actual damages and special effects of the various weapons are determined by the CiC when the weapons are introduced to the session. When the base damage is combined with weapon effects, it is not at all unusual to see your opponents slaughtered ruthlessly before your eyes as your Hurtin’ is raised sky-high.

### Resisting the Hurtin’

Fortunately, characters can attempt to nullify some of this damage by tapping into their craziness. At the time the Hurtin’ is received, you can spend one of your Survival Tokens to try a Quickie, using your current **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** rank and any additional bonuses you may have from other sources. Count the aces and faces you draw, as each one allows you to nullify a single point of incoming Hurtin’. Like any Quickie, you can Negotiate with your Mad Half for bonus cards if you feel you need them.

CiC-controlled Threats can also try this, with the CiC spending Adversity tokens to allow them a Quickie using their role-based hand size, as well as for drawing any necessary bonus draws.

See page 81 in the Survival Tokens section for more details.

### Removing the Hurtin’

Characteristic ranks lost to Hurtin’ can be restored by using Survival tokens during the between-scene downtimes. See page 83 for more details.

### Biting the Bullet

Violence in ***Cannibal Contagion*** can be quite deadly. This is intended. If you experience an entire multi-hour gaming session without anyone dying, then either your players are really frickin’ awesome or your CiC is really frickin’ lax, or both.

As the game progresses and the Showdowns are played out, your character will very likely suffer many points of Hurtin’, which directly reduce your Characteristics. When your character runs out of Characteristic ranks, her death is an imminent and unfortunate fact. Either immediately upon having your ranks eliminated, or at least very soon thereafter, your character should suffer some form of grisly, disturbing, and/or hilarious demise. The other Survivors should be encouraged to react to this, and possibly change the focus of the scene to how they decide to deal with your death.

Fortunately, character death is not the end of the line for you in a game of ***Cannibal Contagion***. When you eventually reach that crossroads, there are several options available to you, including making a new Survivor, turning an existing Ally into a Survivor, or even continuing play as an Infected cannibal.

#### Creating a New Survivor

Should you wish to keep on fighting the good fight, you can easily just stat up a new character (the random character generation rules are great for this) and jump back in when the CiC deems it dramatically appropriate. Introducing a new character usually requires the player waiting for a new scene to be framed, unless the CiC thinks a new character can easily be introduced on the fly during the current scene, perhaps by simply converting an existing “wallflower” character. The rules for creating this new character are the same as for creating any other Survivor. Keep playing the game with your new character and enjoy the quest for survival.

#### Promoting an Ally

You can even take over the role of any Allies that might have been previously narrated into the game. In such a case, quickly give the Ally some Characteristics and a Crazy-Go-Psycho meter (they start with a number of CGP determined by the CiC). If the Ally has taken any Hurtin’ previously, then be sure to subtract that amount from their newly-assigned Characteristic ranks before continuing. Their previous Ally Rank becomes their new starting Survival Token stash.

#### Playing a Turned Survivor

But what if your Survivor has become Infected and turned by the game’s Contagion? Usually this means that she becomes a turned Threat under the control of the CiC. But if the CiC is cool with it, you might be able to keep playing as the infected cannibal version of your old character. If this is something both of you think would be fun, then ask the CiC how it is done (the rules are in the CiC section of this book). A planned future supplement will cover rules for playing an entire group of infected Cannibals, and turning the tables back around on those pesky Survivors!

## Gear and Weapons

Gadgets, swords, medkits, gas masks, toboggans and more, when you’re trying to survive against the cannibals hordes, you need to be well-equipped. In a game of ***CC***, there are two types of equipment that have any mechanical importance: **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gear</span>** and **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Weapons</span>**.

### Gear

Gear in ***CC*** is considered any tangible item or possession that could somehow be used to help you do stuff. Cars, medical supplies, survival kits, flares, crowbars, trench coats, life jackets, beer steins, ancient scrolls of divine protection, ammo boxes, Kevlar vests – these are just a few examples. In ***CC***, just about *anything* can be considered gear with the right narration and the CiC’s consent. When you acquire new Gear, write it on your character sheet. You can call upon your Gear in Quickies and Showdowns to draw extra cards to help you win, provided you are able to convincingly narrate how that Gear is helping you out.

Gear can be used in a Quickie or Showdown for bonus cards drawn before the play. You can use any one piece of Gear for one of two different results. You can choose to **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Activate</span>** a piece of Gear for a single card bonus to your draw. Doing so allows you to keep that Gear through to the next scene (aside from any other circumstances which might remove it from your possession, of course). Unless the Gear specifically requires Juice (see further below), you can activate this piece of Gear an unlimited number of times during a scene for a bonus draw. Instead of activating and Gear in a test, you can instead choose to **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sacrifice</span>** a single piece of Gear, removing it from your possession permanently in exchange for an immediate **four-card** draw bonus to your current Quickie or Showdown. You *must* declare which effect you are using *before* you draw the bonus cards during the Showdown.

Any time you use Gear, you must be able to satisfactorily narrate exactly how the Gear is being used. You must state aloud how you are throwing that Gas Can to try and add more damage to your attack (most likely a sacrifice). You must narrate how those awesome lockpicks bypass that complex security door (activate). You must be able to describe how that bulletproof vest is giving you extra protection against that magnum (activate). Gear that cannot be evoked to the satisfaction of the CiC cannot be used – just having that “Lucky Hat” won’t give you any extra oomph, for example. You have to be able to narrate exactly *how* it is helping you.

Here are some common examples of Gear use:

* Use a “Car” Gear in a Showdown to help run down some Bad Guys
* Use a “Bulletproof Vest” Gear to help a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** Quickie after getting shot by a zombie cop.
* Use a “Nightvision Goggles” Gear in a Showdown to help your aim in the darkness.
* Use a “Whiskey Flask” Gear in a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cool</span>** Check to help yourself stay calm by taking a long swig of that Tennessee Red.

Any gear can be sacrificed with the right flavorful description. A car can be sacrificed by gunning the motor so hard that it kunks out, a medkit can have its supplies exhausted, an ammo case can be emptied, armor can be so riddled with bullet holes it is rendered useless, and so on.

### Running Out Of Juice

Some articles of Gear have a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Juice</span>** requirement, which is simply a Yes or No as to whether or not that item needs Juice (and a number telling how much Juice it uses). Juice is an all-encompassing ammunition trait, and all items that need “fuel” of some kind handle it in pretty much the same way, mechanically. For example:

* Weapons that require ammo (guns, chainsaws, flamethrowers, grenades, etc)
* Equipment that requires power (electronics, cars, flashlights, radios, etc)
* Vices that are limited (drugs, smokes, booze, etc)
* Materials that can be exhausted (medkits, food, cleaning supplies, etc)

When introducing Gear, give it a name and determine if it requires Juice, and if so determine its **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Juice Cost</span>**. A small medkit might have a J4 cost, a sawed-off shotgun a J6 cost, and a pack of smokes might have a J1 cost. In any Quickie or Showdown in which you use a piece of Gear that requires Juice, be your cards successful or unsuccessful, you should mark one or more tallies for that item’s Juice, based on the Gear’s Juice Cost, if any; a shotgun with a J5 stat, for example, gains five Juice tallies each time it is used. Should your actual highest-played card ever be ***lower*** than this number, then you have run out of Juice, and cannot use that Gear again until you somehow acquire more Juice. In certain cases like expendable items (grenades, smokes, booze, etc), you should erase the Gear off your sheet entirely.

Should you run out of Juice in this fashion, you can choose to spend a Survival token to attempt a Juice Check. This is a standard **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** Quickie, and you can try and Negotiate for more cards (certain special Gear might help out, too). If successful, then you did not run out of Juice, and you can drop your current Juice tally by the number of faces and aces you drew. If a Joker, your Juice tally is eliminated completely.

Otherwise, you’re out of Juice; it’s time to find more Juice or get yourself a new piece of gear. Either the CiC can narrate at a later time that you find some ammo or batteries or some such which help you out, or you can do the same later via cleverly-applied Facts. Finding more Juice in this way allows you to freely attempt another Juice Check (as described in the previous paragraph).

> **Example**: Carla has been blasting away with her shotgun for several consecutive Showdowns. Her Shotgun has a Juice stat of +4, so every time she uses it in a Showdown, her player (Vera) marks down four Juice tallies. The first time she uses it, after all has been resolved she marks in four Juice dots next to the gun on Carla’s sheet. The next Showdown, she uses it again, and since her final card if a Nine of Clubs (which is thankfully higher than her current Juice tally of 4), she is not yet out of Juice, and marks down another four tallies (total of eight). In the next Showdown, she uses the Shotgun yet again, and this time her final card is a Seven of Spades, which is lower than her Juice total. This means she has just run out of Juice!

Vera decides to try a Juice check after the Showdown is resolved. She spends one of her Survival Tokens in order to make a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** check. Her **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** is currently at three, so she draws three cards, getting a Two of Diamonds, and the Jack and Queen of hearts. Basic success means that she doesn’t run out of Juice, and the two faces also reduce her Juice tally from eight to six.

In a later scene, Vera wants to find some more ammo. Carla and her crew are in the sporting goods section of an abandoned and mostly-looted TargoPlexMart. Vera thinks Carla should be able to try and find some more Juice, and Screg allows her to try another Juice Check for free, saying that this one was known to have a firearms display in the sporting goods department. Vera makes another Juice check, drawing three cards (based on Carla’s **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>**). She gets one face – an Ace of Diamonds. This reduces her shotgun’s current Juice tally from six to five. Vera says that Carla finds a handful of shells that rolled underneath a broken cabinet, just enough to give her a few more uses.

### Acquiring and Losing Gear

Gear can be acquired pretty much anywhere and at any time, with the CiC’s permission. If you are searching in the game and you find a crowbar, for example, then you can feel free to write it down on your sheet as a new piece of Gear. If you are specifically looking for some Gear in the game, the CiC might require you to make one or more Quickies in order to uncover something.

Likewise, Gear can be taken away or lost at any time, too. The most common times for this to happen are either at the beginning of a new scene *(”Ok, you guys are now running through the halls of the asylum, you’re each wearing only a hospital gown, since your other stuff was all taken from you by the scientists when they captured you. Erase all your Gear!”*) or as a result of Facts at the end of a Showdown (*“I hit him so hard his helmet shatters into a million pieces!”*). Note that if the CiC takes away your Gear between scenes, it costs her Adversity Tokens (see page 132).

If the acquisition of Gear is narrated, write it down on your sheet and enjoy the spoils of your efforts. Likewise, if your Gear is taken away, erase it. Don’t forget to keep track of your Gear slots!

#### Situational Gear

It’s possible to use random bits of scenery as Gear, too. For example, if you’re in a middle-management office fighting a zombie, you can expect to find all sorts of office supplies, a desk, a chair, a computer, etc. You can easily narrate that you grab, say, a paperweight and smash it over the head of the zombie. With the CiC’s permission, that can even give you bonus draws.

### Special Requisite Gear

The CiC might rule that for some actions or proposed Quickies, it is necessary to use or possess certain types of Gear. A door might require a special “Crimson Key” Gear in order for the characters to open it. A character might find a special “zombie cologne” gear that makes it impossible for the cannibals to attack her. The launch silo will let them use its resources, but only if they possess the “Operator’s Manual” and are able to crack the codes within it by using the “Dangerous Digital Interpreter.”

For example, the normal rules state that you can spend a Survival Token to try a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** Quickie in order to resist incoming Hurtin’ from any source. However, the CiC might decide that this rule only applies to non-ballistic attacks, and that in order to perform such Quickies against guns, your character must have special protection, like a Gear called “Kevlar Vest.” Or instead, he might decide to let you try to test without spending a token at all.

### Recovery Gear

With the CiC’s permission, some Gear can be sacrificed during the between-scene downtime for small token bonuses when trying to recover lost Characteristics and remove CGP points. These items will be noted as “recovery” items, and when sacrificed between scenes they can add bonus tokens to the costs required to recover. See page 83 for more details on using Survival Tokens and recovery items.

### Gear Limits: No, you can’t carry 20 rifles, Splick!

The Survivors have a limit to the amount of Gear they can carry. A lot of survival horror video games enforce this, and while some games tend to do it in a rather frustrating manner, it can frequently help establish a feel of desperation. This rule limits the effective Showdown-winning power of the Survivors, and forces them to take more care with arming themselves for their upcoming fights against the cannibal hordes.

Each Weapon and piece of Gear takes up one or more “slots” of your character’s inventory. Different items and weapons will take up a different number of slots, although if the CiC wishes to keep this mechanic on the ridiculous side, she can just say that every item takes up a single slot, regardless of its shape and size. Each character is limited to a number of items equal to twice their **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>**. Why **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>**? Because characters with higher ranks in that will know how to more effectively stow their stuff on their person, that’s why. Yes, this means that a Survivor without any ranks in her Savvy will not be able to carry Gear, unless she uses an item that gives her more slots.

Additionally, certain items give a small boost in storage capacity, like satchels, packs, and bags. Each of these items grants a number of bonus slots (two or more) to the character’s Gear limit. Of course, should the container be lost, everything inside it would be lost, too. Also, as a general guideline, the CiC can rule that any pieces of Gear that can be suitably worn (vests, gas masks, gloves, hats, sunglasses, combat boots, etc) do not take up slots while worn.

Included below is a list of various example weapons and items and a suggested slot size (or modifier) for each one. Any entry with an plus sign next to its number does not use slots, instead giving you additional inventory slots equal to the listed number.

| Gear        | Slots | Gear          | Slots | Gear          | Slots | 
|-------------|-------|---------------|-------|---------------|-------| 
| 2x4         | 2     | First Aid Kit | 1     | Pocket Tool   | 1     | 
| Backpack    | +3    | Flashlight    | 1     | Rope          | 2     | 
| Bazooka     | 3     | Garden Hoe    | 2     | Rusty pipe    | 2     | 
| Binoculars  | 1     | Gas Mask      | 1     | Shovel        | 2     |

### Weapons

When battling against the cannibal hordes, you’ll need a good weapon if you want to survive; arsenals are even better. In ***CC***, a good weapon can make all the difference between horrible death and grim survival, and in this section you will learn how to create and use just about any weapon you can think of.

In ***CC***, there are two main methods which you can use to handle weapon mechanics in-game. The first and easiest method is to simply use weapons as if they were special Gear, giving you bonuses to relevant Showdowns when using those weapons. If you play them like this, the weapons can be called just like normal Gear, giving you a *single* bonus card when activated or *four* bonus cards when Sacrificed. The CiC can arbitrarily deem some weapons to give more of a bonus than others, and some weapons to only be usable as sacrifices (such as grenades and Molotov cocktails).

If you’re looking to place less in-game emphasis upon gathering weapons, and want to play a game with more focus on story and survival than on first-person shooter-style murdering and loot-grabbing, then I suggest using the Gear method. It will allow you to spend less time dealing with weapon mechanics, and more time coming up with conflicts of a more character-personal basis as the players think less about combat and more about the survival and goals of their characters. However, if you want a lot of high-octane butt-kicking with wild and crazy weapons, keep reading.

#### Custom Weapons

The second method of weapon implementation in ***CC*** involves the creation of random and/or custom weapons, and can give your games a much heavier dose of crazy carnage than the Gear method. Using these mechanics, weapons have multiple in-game statistics that affect cards drawn in Showdowns, Hurtin’ dealt with successful plays, how much Juice the weapon can use before it runs dry, and more. By allowing the custom weapons into your game, you are letting the players know that this game will have a lot of action, and you’re cool with that.

With this system, weapons now possess their own special category of mechanics. Weapons will have a handful of variable stats that can be predetermined or drawn completely at random. With the custom weapons option, you may find that randomly statting-out your weapons can be a butt-load of fun all by itself.

##### Introducing Custom Weapons

Using the custom weapons system, new weapons can be introduced in one of three manners:

* The CiC lets a player start with a weapon
* The CiC narrates the discovery of a weapon
* A player narrates the discovery of a weapon when they win a Showdown.

The CiC can introduce a weapon at any time she feels appropriate. They can be brought into the scene by enemies, found in hidden caches, dropped by magical flying weapon fairies, or introduced in just about any other way the CiC feels works best for the game. Players can also introduce them with Facts when they narrate their Showdown success, although players who do so too frequently should not be surprised when their CiC picks on them. Players can also acquire them between scenes, using Survival Tokens (see page 83 for more details).

##### Weapon Stats

The following is a list of all the various weapon stats in a custom-weapons game of *Cannibal Contagion*:

* **Draw Bonus:** This sets how many bonus card draws you get in Showdowns *activating* this weapon as a piece of Gear. Note that if you activate a weapon as Gear, you cannot use any potential Hurtin’ bonus in the same Showdown!
* **Hurtin’ Bonus:** This sets how much bonus Hurtin’ you deal when you win Showdowns using this weapon.
* **Juice Cost:** This sets how much the weapon’s Juice Tally increases with each use. If this is written as a fraction such as 1/X, then the weapon gains 1 Juice tally after every X uses. Obviously, if the weapon is one that does not realistically require Juice, then this stat is ignored.
* **Special:** Some weapons have extra-special modifiers, powers, and circumstances. Some of these effects are beneficial, some are detrimental.

When using the Custom Weapons option, you can choose to implement any or all of these special weapon stats. If you only care about the Hurtin’ Bonus, for example, then forget about the rest and only determine that stat.

When a weapon enters the game, as the CiC you can choose to either assign any or all of the weapon’s mechanical stats, or you can use card draws to randomly stat it up. When doing this, draw a card for each of the stats that you wish to randomly determine, and then compare those cards to the random weapon table in the back of the book. If you like, you can even choose to give it a random special effect of some kind, just to make it more interesting.

For example, let’s say you’re running a game and you decide to throw in a sword that the characters find in a museum. Instead of just giving it appropriate stats, you figure it would be fun to randomize it. You draw three cards: one for Hurtin’, one for Draw bonus, and one for a special effect (just ‘cause) – none for Juice, of course, because it’s unlikely that a sword would need Juice. You draw a nine, a seven, and a four. From left to right, the nine gives the sword a Hurtin’ bonus of +2, the seven gives it a Draw bonus of one, and the four makes it Lame (ouch!). Quite an interesting weapon indeed!

Once you’ve determine the weapon’s modifiers, right down the weapon’s name on your character sheet, and in the “Notes” section jot down any modifiers or abilities that may have turned up.

##### Special Qualities

When drawing on the weapon chart, you can choose to also use the Special Attribute column to give the weapon an additional odd trait of some kind. Some of these are beneficial to the user, while others make the weapon less effective or are otherwise detrimental. The list of abilities are as follows:

* **Ammo hog**: Juice checks costs 1 more Survival Token gain than normal
* **Dial Goes to Eleven**: Spend Survival token, increase all stats by +1 for a single Showdown (Draw, Hurtin’, and Juice Cost)
* **Disposable**: Cannot replenish Juice in any way
* **Easy to find ammo**: +1 **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** for all Juice Checks
* **Hard to find ammo**: -1 **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** for all Juice Checks
* **Knock-off**: Does 2 less Hurtin’ than normal
* **Lame**: Requires the expenditure of a Survival token each time it is used
* **Last resort**: Requires an Ace to do Hurtin’, but does x2 total Hurtin’ if successful
* **Penetrating**: Opponent cannot make **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** checks to nullify Hurtin’
* **Psychobilly**: Can take CGP points to cause extra Hurtin’, one for one, up to 4
* **Recharging**: Remove 1 Juice tally at end of each scene
* **Scary**: Each successful attack against a Survivor causes them 1 point of CGP
* **Self-destruct**: Can be sacrificed after Showdown to double total Hurtin’
* *Joker*: Draw twice, applying both! (Ignore this if drawn again)

#### Optional Rule: Double-Fisting

Sometimes players may want to use multiple weapons at the same time. If the CiC allows it, this can be done by taking the best attributes of the two weapons, and dividing their total allowed Card Draw by two, rounding down. Any bonus cards drawn by gaining CGP cost double the normal CGP points. Using two weapons in this fashion can significantly boost your CGP meter, but if they’re good weapons they might be totally worth going apeshit and shooting every last mofo in the room.

#### Remember: Weapons are Gear!

It’s important to remember that custom Weapons are still Gear just like everything else. They must be noted in your character’s Gear list with all her other equipment. Like Gear, weapons can be activated for a bonus draw on any Quickie or Showdown, or can be sacrificed for four bonus draws on any Quickie or Showdown. However, if you intend to use any of the custom weapon stats in a battle (bonus Hurtin’, for example, or special powers), then you can not also Activate or Sacrifice it for additional draws. Note that if sacrificed in combat, they ***can not*** use any of the weapon’s other stats in that Showdown, including Draw Bonus and Hurtin’ modifiers.

#### Threats and Weapons

Threats can use Gear and Weapons just like any other character in the game, unless your setting’s nuances deem otherwise. For example, if you’re playing with zombies along the George Romero lines, then chances are the cannibals will be very unlikely to use items. On the other hand, Bad Guys with any capability are likely to be just as equipped as the Survivors, if not better. In fact, Threats can often be good sources of new weapons (kill them all and take their stuff, right?). The characters could be assisted by some soldiers, only to have those soldiers slaughtered by an attacking horde of monsters, leaving the players to grab their weapons and fight back.

## Allies

As the Survivors try to stay alive through the terrors of the zombie apocalypse, they will very likely encounter and recruit like-minded fellows to assist them in their efforts. These folks might be stranded kids looking to get out of a burning building, or road-hardened survivalists in a recreational vehicle, or even battle-trained cops that help escort the Survivors to safety. Whatever the case, they can join the cause of our heroes and assist them in several ways, including bonus cards in Showdowns or even leaping in front of dangers to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the heroes.

Since ***Cannibal Contagion*** is a game focused primarily on the Survivors and the monsters which menace them, Allies will always take a more backseat role to the exploits of the heroes and bad guys. They might lend a hand and help out in some really tight spots, and they might even take bullets that were meant for the Survivors, but they will rarely start conflicts or take major initiatives, instead leaving the spotlight to the players and their characters.

Like Gear, Allies can be narrated into a scene at any time by the CiC without the expenditure of any tokens.

### Allies in Play

Allies are considered “non-player” characters, and are thus narrated by the CiC. Their actions and attitudes and personalities are entirely under the control of the CiC, although he can hand them out to the players if he wishes. It can speed play along significantly if the allies are just assigned to various players to manage.

Mechanically, Allies function as special Gear, with three important functions. The first function is a lot like the regular use of other Gear. Each Ally has two stats, the first being their **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ally Rank</span>** and the second being an associated Characteristic (either **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kill</span>** or **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>**). The Ally Rank determines how many bonus cards that Ally can provide in a Quickie or Showdown, while the associated Characteristic denotes which Quickies or Showdowns the Ally can assist. The Ally Rank will be a number from 1 (marginally helpful) to 4 (professionally adept), depending on the competence and intended usefulness of the Ally.

For example, a S.W.A.T. Member Ally with an Ally Rank of “4-Kill” can provide four bonus draws to another player in a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kill</span>**-based Showdown or Quickie. That same Ally could not, however, help out with any **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>**-based tests. If there are multiple participants in the Showdown, the bonus cards provided by an Ally can be divided up as the players see fit. Additionally, should such a situation ever arise, an Ally can attempt a Quickie or Showdown on its own, using its Ally Rank as cards.

> **Example**: Max Benton (played by Splick) is searching the rubble of the military compound for any useful equipment he can get his hands on. Screg says he can try a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** Quickie to see if he finds anything. Max Benton only has one rank in **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>**, and doesn’t have any Gear that can help him out. Fortunately for him, he is accompanied by an ally named Norm (Rank 1-Savvy), so he asks Norm to help him out. Norm is being played by Screg (the CiC), who offers Splick a single bonus draw from Norm’s assistance.

The second core function of Allies is also much like Gear, and is called the Blaze of Glory. Much like Gear can be sacrificed for extra cards, Allies can sacrifice themselves to go out in a blaze of guns and glory. Doing so is just like sacrificing Gear, only the bonus cards you get are double the number of bonus cards that Ally normally provides. Suitable narration is, of course, required. For example, in a violent Showdown, the Ally can charge into the fray with twin machetes, hacking at the enemies but getting bitten in half in the process. Or maybe during a Quickie to help the Survivor lift a boulder out of the way, the Ally takes the burden, letting the heroes escape but getting crushed once they’re gone.

> **Example**: In a later scene, Max Benton and his ally Policeman Joe (Ally rank 3-Kill) are confronted by a pack of ravenous ghouls (Hindrance w/ Threat 8). Max has taken some Hurtin’ in the previous scenes, and his payer (Splick) doesn’t think that Max can survive if the ghouls get to act on their own. Taking the initiative, Splick announces that Max and Joe get the jump on the ghouls, charging in guns blazing. Max’s Kill rank is only 1, and he can’t afford to Negotiate for bonus cards, so he announced that Policeman Joe is taken by the moment and jumps right in, sacrificing himself to kill these undead bastards. Joe’s Blaze of Glory gets Max six more bonus cards (twice Joe’s Ally rank of 3), so Max Benton now has seven cards for this Showdown. Win or lose, however, Joe’s grisly death must be taken into account during the outcome narration.

Finally, the third function of Allies allows players to have them take damage in place of the Survivors. Any time an Ally is helping a character in a Showdown and the Survivor loses, that Survivor’s player can narrate how any of the Hurtin’ she would take is instead taken by the Ally. The Hurtin’ is applied to the Ally’s Rank, and cannot be soaked. If the Ally takes Hurtin’ greater than or equal to his Rank, he dies.

Note that Allies can become Infected just like any other character in the game. The CiC has the rules on how to handle this.

> **Example**: Carla was in a Showdown against some Trash Ghouls, and helping her was her new buddy Pablo the Mechanic (Ally Rank 3-Kill). Unfortunately, Carla and Pablo lost the Showdown, and despite her best efforts to soak, Carla is being hit with two points of Hurtin’. Vera elects to have Pablo take the Hurtin’ instead, narrating how he pushed Carla out of the way and got sliced up in her place. Pablo takes the two points of Hurtin’ which reduce his Ally Rank from 3 to 1. Pablo’s Ally Rank is now permanently reduced to 1, unless he is somehow healed during scene downtime.

### Allies-turned-Survivors

Should a Survivor ever die (or a new player joins in the middle of the game), the player can choose to continue playing the game as any currently-existing Ally introduced in the game, if they so desire. In such a case, have them quickly give the Ally some Characteristics and a CiC-assigned Crazy-Go-Psycho meter. Their Ally Rank becomes their new starting Survival Token stash. The player now controls this character as a new Survivor.

### Ally Death

Allies, like Survivors and Threats, require Hurtin’ to be killed. In any Showdown in which the CiC causes Hurtin’ to the Survivors, he can target any involved Ally with any amount of that Hurtin’ as if they were a Survivor.

## Survival Tokens and Character Recovery

As the game progresses, the Survivors are likely to take one hefty pounding to both their health and their psyches. Many Showdowns will end with one or more of them either losing Characteristic ranks to Hurtin’, gaining Crazy-Go-Psycho points through Mad Half Negotiations, or both. To help assuage this frequent loss to the characters’ abilities, ***Cannibal Contagion*** uses **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Survival Tokens</span>** to allow characters to recover some of the losses between scenes, as well as a few mid-scene resistance empowerments.

The Survival Tokens are in place to provide both a reward for doing awesome things in the game, and a way to simulate recovery of health, sanity, and supplies both during and between scenes.

### Gaining Survival Tokens

As the scenes are played through, you can acquire Survival tokens in a multitude of ways. These add up over time, and you can save them as long as you like. Below are some examples of methods for acquiring Survival Tokens.

* Suggest an awesome New Scene idea
* Exchange Aces or Faces after winning a Showdown
* Gain your **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** rank in tokens at the *beginning* of a new scene, plus a number of tokens equal to the number of scenes that have *passed*.
* Fulfill one of the Secret Votes for +8 tokens (see page 28)
* Complete bonus objectives during a scene (predetermined by the CiC)
* Do awesome things that impress the CiC
* Kill another Survivor! When you do so, you gain all of their current stockpile of Survival Tokens.
* Buy the CiC food (hey, it doesn’t hurt to try – I prefer pizza, red/yellow curries, and everything in the special “breakfast” food group)

### Using Survival Tokens Mid-Scene

While most of the uses of Survival Tokens are for end-of-scene recovery and advancement, there are three mid-scene uses for them that should not be ignored by any means: **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** checks to resist Hurtin and Infection, and **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** checks to keep your Gear from running out of Juice.

#### Resisting Hurtin’ (1 token, non-repetitive)

When you lose a Showdown and take Hurtin’, you have the option of spending a Survival Token to attempt a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** Quickie and try to soak some or all of that Hurtin’. Spend the token and then draw a standard Quickie based on your **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** score. Each face or ace resists a point of Hurtin’. You can attempt at most one Quickie to resist the Hurtin’ of any one Showdown, but you can always try and Negotiate for more draws per the standard rules.

> **Example**: Carla just got bitten by some hellhounds, for five points of Hurtin’. Five points could seriously set her back, so Vera (her player) elects to try a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** check. She spends one of Carla’s Survival tokens and sets to it. Carla’s Grit is currently at rank three, so Vera draws three cards and gets two faces. She has room for more CGP, and elects to gain a few more points to try for cards. She first talks to her Mad Half to see if she can try for more cards – her Mad Half agrees, but limits her to at most three more draws. She takes a point and draws a card, getting another face, then takes another point but this time only draws a number card. She calls it at that, resisting three points of Hurtin’ and taking two. She gains two points of CGP total from this, as she elected to only draw two more bonus cards, and not the full maximum of three that her Mad Half had allowed.

#### Resist Infection (1 point, non-repetitive)

If you lose a Showdown against a creature that can Infect you, you spend a Survival Token to try a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** Quickie in order to reduce some of the incoming points of Infection. This is a standard Quickie, and you can Negotiate per normal rules for more cards. Each face or ace resists one point of Infection, and if all are resisted, you completely avoid the Infection (provided you weren’t already infected from a previous situation).

Note that in many games, the CiC will keep the Infection tallies of the players a secret. In such cases, when you are attacked by Infectious enemies, it is up to you to declare when you want to try this Quickie, and the CiC is under no obligation to tell you how many points you have coming at you, or how many you have successfully resisted. The CiC doesn’t even have to tell you that the attack is even contagious at all. This can make the game *really* tense.

You can attempt at most one Quickie to resist the Infection of any one Showdown, but you can always try to Negotiate with your Mad Half for more cards.

> **Example**: Roger just lost a Showdown against a nasty zombie, and took two total points of Hurtin’ (his attempt to soak the Hurtin’ failed miserably). Screg knows the zombie is of course infected, and that if Karo (Roger’s player) doesn’t try to resist, Roger will become Infected with three points of Infection. But in this game, Screg’s keeping the Infection totals secret, so he says “You know, Karo, that these bastards infect through wounds, and you’ve just taken a nasty one. You gonna do anything about it?” Karo sweats a little, and decides to try and resist. He spends a Survival token to attempt a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** Quickie, drawing two cards (his **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** score). He gets two aces, and decides to leave it at that, thinking himself safe (and declining any temptation to talk to his Mad Half). Screg nods and says nothing, but secretly notes that Roger now is Infected with a single tally. That’s definitely going to be a problem in the near future…

#### Juice Check (1 token, non-repetitive)

When you run out of Ammo, you can spend a Survival Token to attempt a Juice Check. This is a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** Quickie, and if you succeed then you do not run out of Juice just yet. Additionally, each face or ace reduces your Juice tally by one. As with other Quickies, you can attempt at most one such Quickie per Juice check, but you can try to Negotiate with your Mad Half to draw more cards during that Quickie. See page 66 for more details on Juice and examples on how it works.

### Using Survival Tokens Between Scenes

After a scene ends, the CiC will go through a short checklist of administrivia before kicking off the next scene. During this time is when you can exchange some or all of your accrued Survival tokens in order to recover from any losses your character has suffered up ‘til now.

* “Purchase” new Gear
* Recharge your Juice tallies
* Recover lost Characteristic Ranks
* Remove accumulated Crazy-Go-Psycho points
* Remove a single stage of Madness
* Purchase New Gear (2 tokens per Gear, 4 per Weapon)

You can “purchase” new items of Gear between scenes, representing things you might have picked up during the “off-screen” moments. Each piece of Gear you purchase costs 2 tokens, and must be approved by the CiC. If the game uses Custom Weapons rules, you can purchase new weapons for 4 tokens each, again requiring CiC approval.

#### Recharge Juice (1 token per Juice stat)

Each Survival token you exchange to recover Juice recharges a single piece of Gear by its Juice stat. For example, if you use a Survival token to recharge a flashlight that has a J1 stat, you will recharge a single point off the Juice tally. On the other hand, if you use it to recharge a pistol with a J3 stat, you can erase up to three tallies off that item per token spent.

#### Increase Characteristics (4 or 6 tokens per rank)

You can spend Survival tokens to recover lost Characteristic ranks, and increase your ranks even higher. Each four Survival tokens you spend increase a Characteristic rank by +1, up to their starting maximums (which you assigned at creation). Once you’ve reached the maximum in a Characteristic, it costs six tokens per rank you wish to increase it higher. Some special gear (such as a medkit, drugs, etc) can be sacrificed for a two-token bonus to this with the CiC’s approval. Note that this does not increase the actual maximums, and only increases the current ranks *above* those maximums.

#### Remove CGP (2 tokens per tally)

You can spend Survival tokens to remove Crazy-Go-Psycho points you have accrued. Each two Survival tokens you spend remove a single point of CGP from your meter, to a minimum of zero. Some special gear (such as a bottle of anti-depressants) can be sacrificed for a one-token bonus to this with the CiC’s approval. Note that you cannot remove more points than are currently in your tally! If you wish to upgrade your actual madness stage, you must use the next option below.

#### Degrade Madness (6 tokens)

After each scene, you can spend Survival Tokens to remove a stage from your current madness meter. This costs six tokens, and allows you to un-circle the lowest stage on your descent into madness. You can only remove a single stage after each scene. Any currently-accrued CGP points carry over to the new stage, however.

### The Survival Pool

In addition to the personal stashes of Survival tokens possessed by each individual player, the players as a group have access to a special team Survival Pool. This stash of tokens functions like all other Survival tokens, except everyone can add to it and draw from it at will, at any time. Using this pool, players get a bonus for working together against the bad guys. This is also the **only** in-game mechanic that allows the players to give each other Survival tokens.

There are both advantages and disadvantages to using the Survival Pool. On the plus side, any player can draw from it, using a bit of added group synergy to help them recover when needed. By working together and helping each other survive the madness, it will automatically go up at the end of every scene.

On the down side, as stated before, *any player* can draw indiscriminately from the Survival Pool, without needing group approval. Once you put tokens in the Pool, you have no say over their expenditure unless you spend them yourself. Additionally, since it costs *two* of your own tokens to increase the pool by a single token, it can be costly to do so.

If ever multiple players wish to use the same tokens from this pool at the same time, either come to a compromise or have each player draw-off for them.

The Survival Pool is increased in the following two ways:

* For each Survivor *and* Ally alive at the end of a scene, increase the Survival Pool +1. This happens *before* they choose to spend tokens to recover their aspects.
* Any player can donate to the Pool, increasing it +1 for every *two* Survival Tokens they spend from their own personal stash.

#### Killing Other Survivors

Yes, you read that correctly above: when a Survivor deals the killing blow to another Survivor, she wins the dead Survivor’s current stash of Survival tokens. Should other Survivors have helped her in the Showdown that dealt the killing blow, she can, *at the time she receives those tokens*, choose to divvy any or all of them out to her helpers, if she so desires. She doesn’t have to, of course, but the option is there for that moment in time. Of course, if the CiC ever kills a Survivor, he gets that Survivor’s stash added to his own Adversity pool. Watch out!

## Winning The Game

When the game ends, the Survivor who acquired the most votes from the other players (via the Secret Votes cards) *and then subsequently fulfilled as many of them as possible* is declared the winner. If two or more players tie, they must duel to the death. Congratulations, you have won Cannibal Contagion! You should go online and tell us all about it!

## Player Tips

Here I’ve compiled some helpful game-play tips for players new to the system, based on things I’ve noticed in my own games, and advice I’ve picked up from others along the way.

**When in dire straits, Negotiate!** By gaining Crazy-go-Psycho points you can make great things happen at the cost of going batshit nuts. I’ve seen good players skate through a game on sheer Crazy alone. Going crazy isn’t really a bad thing either, as it only makes the game more fun, and with careful balancing of risk and reward, you can totally go apeshit while keeping your CGP tallies at relatively sane levels. See page 91 for more details on Crazy-Go-Psycho empowerment.

Keep in mind that ***Cannibal Contagion*** **is only made more fun by the in-game situation being completely FUBAR’d.** Don’t fret when bad stuff happens to your character, because it’s supposed to. Just take it in stride, pop back and give it all you’ve got. Don’t get butt-hurt if and when your character gets injured or even dies, as that’s all part of the fun. Heck, sometimes it’s even fun to proudly say that you died first.

**Remember: there will be some fights that you just can’t and/or won’t win.** There will be times when you face monsters with really high Threat Scores that just seem to keep kicking your ass. If you can’t defeat them with Showdowns, try working together with the other players to gang up on them, and consider using the scene to your advantage. Narrate obstacles and escapes, and don’t forget that running away is one of the keys to survival.

**Don’t Turtle up!** ***Cannibal Contagion*** is a game that favors and rewards players who seize the initiative and push conflicts directly and with gusto. If a player or the CiC narrates something that you disagree with, and you think your character can directly change it, then voice your dissent. If a few moments of discussion don’t satisfy you, challenge it and call a Showdown! Let the cards decide, and be prepared to narrate should you succeed. If you just sit there and react, then you’re not pushing the game forward, and a game that isn’t pushed forward goes nowhere. That’s not fun.

## To Dance with the Devil Inside

Let’s face it: with all this crazy cannibal zombie-monster shit going down, sometimes your characters are just going to break down and wig out. Zombies, demons, monsters and more, most humans just aren’t prepared for this kind of stuff. A typical human reaction to such things is to freak the hell out. Don’t worry, it’s the human thing to do, and you all want to stay human, right? Of course you do, otherwise you’d be a wacked-out murderous zombie creature, and no one wants that, right? Right? Yeah, that’s what I thought.

As the game is played, characters will often face things which can drive normal men mad. Seeing your friends and family murdered before your eyes can be maddening enough, but what if you’re the one actually murdering them yourself because they’re trying to eat you? In desperate times, people do desperate things, and sometimes those people can draw upon that madness to push them along and keep themselves alive. You know how these stories tend to go – you either get killed or go crazy. Those who fight the hardest to survive are usually quite rattled by their experiences, and oftentimes there is little humanity left in them in the end to differentiate them from the monsters they’ve had to slaughter in order to stay alive. Their madness gave them power during their journey, but broke them in the end.

That’s exactly how ***Cannibal Contagion*** works. Your characters have been thrown smack dab into the middle of the craziest shit they’ve never believed could happen. They will be forced to do terrible things in order to scrabble for the barest sliver of hope for survival. As they face the horrors of the apocalypse, they will draw upon that madness in the hopes that the edge it gives them will be enough for them to make it through to the other side. As that destination draws near, however, their madness could quite likely overtake them. When the tension and events of the game push characters to the brinks of desperation and lunacy, ***CC*** uses Psychotriggers, Crazy-Go-Psycho points, and the Mad Half to bring that craziness into play.

The madness system involves four major variables: Negotiation, the Mad Half, the Psychotrigger, and the CGP meter. These components work together organically to keep your characters moving ever forward towards the brink of Madness. In order to understand how it all works, you need to understand how each of these variables is important on its own. We’ll start with the basics of how it works, and go into more details on the specifics after an example.

## Negotiation and Bonus Cards: How They Work

When you’re drawing your cards in a Showdown and you’re running low on cards, it might be a good idea to try and “dance with the devil” for the chances of a few more. If you need more cards and you’re fresh out of Gear options, and none of your Mojo is helping you out, you should consider asking your Mad Half to allow you to draw upon your inner craziness for a greater chance of success. The act of asking your Mad Half for this assistance is called Negotiation.

However, before you ask for this assistance, you should ask yourself one important question: Do I need this enough to risk going crazy? If you think you can handle the few cards you’ve drawn, then don’t worry about it. But if you think you need those cards, and don’t mind risking a portion of your character’s sanity, then go for it.

The Negotiation process is simple, and mostly the same for both Quickies and Showdowns. When the cards are being drawn, you can turn to your Mad Half and request assistance. This is as simple as saying “Hey Buddy, I need a few extra cards for this Showdown.” The Mad Half can choose to flat-out deny this, of course, but to make it more interesting, they might demand that you grovel harder, or bribe them, or what-have-you.

If the two of you come to an agreement and the Mad Half allows you some empowerment, then they first state *how much* power they’re giving you – meaning, how many cards they will allow you to draw. They can choose to allow you only one, a small handful, or even just say “take as many as you need” if they’re feeling generous.

But there will be a price, oh yes – two, in fact. When the Mad Half offers you bonus cards, they will also state some kind of narrative payment that your character must enact at some point in the scene following the current card-play. This payment – the first of the two prices you must pay – will be directly based upon your character’s Psychotrigger and her current stage on the Madness Meter, both of which your Mad Half should be constantly aware. They can be nice and agreeable, and only demand but a tiny payment from you, or tyrannical and evil, and make you suffer. They can be chaotic, too, acting nice for one request, evil for another, and downright annoying for yet another. Whatever the case and mood may be, you must always pay this narrative price if you wish to benefit from power.

The second price is more mechanical: when you actually accept the bonus cards, each draw you make will earn them a single point of Crazy-Go-Psycho (CGP), which add up to push your character further down the Madness Meter (see further below).

If you agree to the Mad Half’s terms, you can then immediately receive as many of the allowed bonus draws as you wish. In both Quickies and Showdowns, you can draw them one at a time, and you can choose to stop drawing at any point before you’ve drawn the maximum that your Mad Half “gifted” you with.

Once you’ve drawn your cards, resolve the Quickie or Showdown as normal. Afterwards, should you actually survive, you must remember to pay the narrative price. Read further below for more details.

> **Negotiation Example:** Jian is currently standing one on one against Gruesome Henry (a Miniboss-level Threat). Hunter (Jian’s player) knows that at this moment, it’s either kill or be killed, and he’d really prefer the former. Due to a whole string of bad circumstances leading to this moment, Jian’s Kill rank is down to a measly 1, and he has no gear he can suitably bring into the conflict for bonus cards. As it currently stands, he’ll be drawing one card versus Gruesome Henry’s four, and he sees that Screg has a whole mess of Adversity tokens he can blow to give Henry more draws. He has no choice, really, but to try and Negotiate with his Mad Half, who is played by Trin.
> 
> Before the cards are played, Hunter turns to Trin and asks what he’ll need to do for some bonus cards. Jian is currently in the third stage of madness (The Descent), which gives Trin a bit of creative license in determining his price. Jian’ Psychotrigger is “Don’t Touch the Hair!” so she says: “Sure, I’ll let you draw a few cards. Hell, draw as many as you want. But when you’re done with this Threat, you’re going to have to take yet another moment to re-style your hair. Only thing is, this time, as you do it, you will start to imagine that some strands don’t belong, and you’ll pull them out, one by one, painfully, until you snap out of it and realize what you’ve done.”
> 
> Hunter shudders. Jian’s hair is pretty serious to him, but he needs those cards. He agrees to the price. Jian’s Cool is at 4 right now, so he’s not overly concerned about it, and starts drawing. However, when all this is over, if Jian survives the encounter with Gruesome Henry, Hunter has to worry about inserting Trin’s demanded price into the scene before it comes to an end. Plus, for each card he draws, he’ll have to add to his CGP tally, which could drive him even further into the depths of madness…

## The Mad Half and Psychotriggers

Now let’s talk about the guy who gives you that power. During the character creation process, every player must designate one other player at the table to play their character’s Mad Half. Your Mad Half exists solely to tempt you with edge and ability in exchange for a little slice of your character’s sanity. The Mad Half has the power to grant your character the ability to tap into the chaos of the situation and draw from it increased ability and desperate power. Of course, this power comes at a cost: your sanity.

### Choosing Your Mad Half

When choosing Mad Halves, each player must designate one other player at the table, and no one player can be the Mad Half for more than one character. If you’re playing among friends, try and get someone you have a good rivalry with. Your Mad Half should be someone that you believe can pull your strings and make the game more fun for your character by creating internal conflicts that get under your skin.

If you’re running convention games, the default is to just choose the player to the left.

### Playing the Mad Half

When you are the Mad Half, you have a very important responsibility to mentally screw with your designated character (also known as your **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pawn</span>**). The Pawn will frequently beg you for empowerment via Negotiation, and you are responsible for making them truly earn that empowerment. You are given a variable amount of control over certain aspects of that character (based on their current stage of Crazy-go-Psycho), and you can manipulate their Psychotrigger to apply said control.

Your primary responsibility as the Mad Half is to keep tabs on the Pawn’s current stage of insanity, so you can use it against them when the time comes. You can use a note page to scribble down your Pawn’s Psychotrigger and track their craziness, or instead print out the handy Pawn cards for this purpose. Using the “Team Craziness” printable sheet can also help everyone keep track of each other’s stages of sanity. You should keep yourself constantly aware of how crazy they are, because the higher their stage, the more leeway you have for messing with them in the game. For more details on how much control you have, see the “Putting it All Together” section further below.

You also have to constantly work your Pawn’s Psychotrigger into the story. Not only does it play a crucial part in your Negotiations with that player (see below), but it can also be worked frequently into scenes outside of Negotiations as well. Keep reminding the other player of their addiction with subtle narrative cues, and poke at their driving goal and the obsessions that keep them jittery. Work it into your own narrations, and try to push into it when you buy Facts in Showdowns.

Remember, as the Mad Half you are representative of the Pawn’s Insanity. You are the inner forces which struggle to break the character’s mind into many tiny little pieces. You are *not* representative of some metaphysical sinister force (aka the “Dark Side”) or some such. You’re not trying to tempt the character to evil, but to insanity. You are Lunacy, Desperation, Chaos, and Stress, and while those things *can* lead to the performance of evil acts, such should not be your driving goal while playing the Mad Half. Instead, you should be the catalyst for the character’s fall into madness, and should such a fall result in “evil” acts, then so be it, but otherwise “evil” as we typically describe it should not be your heavy-handed focus.

### Psychotriggers

When you created your character, you gave her a special Psychotrigger, which summed up the main focus of her insanity (at least insofar as you intend to role-play that insanity in this game). This represents the Big Thing that either drives your character mad, or else serves as the tool by which she harnesses that madness, or both. It could be a prominent nervous tick, a driving obsession, a very important character goal in the scenario, or more.

Your Psychotrigger is the narrative lever that your Mad Half pulls to make you squirm. When you Negotiate for empowerment, your Mad Half will demand some kind of narrative price from you, which uses your Psychotrigger as its main inspiration. Because of this, your Psychotrigger *needs* to be something solid and evocable. It also needs to be something core to the character, and something a little twisted. It needs to be something that should make you think “Do I really *need* those extra cards right now?” before you even ask for them.

For example, if your Psychotrigger is “Anger management problem,” then whenever you need empowerment, your Mad Half will frequently demand that you perform acts of anger, frustration, and even outright violence. These demands will be really insignificant at first, when you have very few points of Crazy-Go-Psycho. For example, she might demand that in order for you to draw those extra cards in this Showdown, you fire one more bullet into its head after you’ve killed it, just to give it “one for the road.” As your CGP meter rises, however, her demands can (and will!) get more dangerous to both yourself and your fellow survivors. For example, much later in the game, she could very well demand that in order to get just two more bonus cards, you will take your aggressions out afterwards on a teammate, beating them up while screaming how it’s all their fault, how they will thank you for it later.

## Putting it All Together: Using the CGP Meter

Let’s take a look at that Crazy-Go-Psycho meter on your character sheet. This meter has five stages which track the CGP points you accrue each time you successfully make a deal with your Mad Half. As you accrue points, your character will “descend” to the more maddening stages, until eventually they reach the end and go bonkers gonzo nuts.

##### First One’s Always Free

Yes, you read that right. The first time your Pawn asks you for assistance, it’s free. They can get a single free card to their draw without paying any CGP or narrative prices. After that first freebie, though, ain’t no more discounts.

### Paying the Price: The Fives Stages of Madness

Every time you Negotiate a deal with your Mad Half, you must pay a price – two prices, in fact. The Mad Half’s price is always twofold, consisting of both an accruement of Crazy-Go-Psycho points and a narrative demand. The CGP points are added to your tally, while the narrative demand must be played out during the current scene of the game.

Listed below are the five stages of insanity, and some examples of various narrative demands that fit within the scope of the respective stages. We’ll use four different sample Psychotriggers here to show examples of how each stage gives the Mad Half increasing control over the Pawn’s actions.

#### Stage 1: The Calm

Like the calm before the storm, your character is relatively unaffected by the Madness, but in this world gone nuts, it’s only a matter of time before your tight grip upon your sanity starts to weaken. **You start the game at this stage on the meter**.

**Empowerment:** No significant control at all. During Negotiations, the Mad Half can suggest minor things that you must do at some point during the current scene.

* *Cigarette Addiction:* Before this scene is over, you’re going to need to smoke a cigarette.
* *I have to find my missing kids!:* You need to take out that picture of your kids and look at it to remind yourself that they need you.
* *Mindless Aggression:* The tension of the current scene is just too much for you, and before it passes you need to find something in the environment and break it.
* *Obsessive about my Gear:* This is a hectic time, and you need to reorganize your pack before the scene is over.

#### Stage 2: The Brink

The chaos of the times has started to affect you, and the darkness is taking root in your brain. Frequently pushing yourself to your limits has started to take its toll, and you find your hold on reality is weakening. You must try and maintain those habits and emotional bonds that tie you to reality.

**Empowerment:** No control yet, just more negotiation demands are available. The Mad Half can make her demands a bit more serious, affecting your character in the immediate present. If she desires, she can make your character miss the next couple of in-game actions due to various “status effects” like uncontrollable sobbing, obsessive ranting, etc.

* *Cigarette Addiction:* You need to smoke immediately after this Showdown is over. In fact, smoke two.
* *I have to find my missing kids!:* You’re going to look at your kids’ picture and cry in a heap on the floor, useless for a few minutes while you wetly and loudly let it all out.
* *Mindless Aggression:* When you finish this combat, you need to immediately spend a few moments pounding your fist into the now-dead zombie’s head, until your knuckles are bloody enough to bring you back into reality.
* *Obsessive about my Gear:* You NEED to organize your pack RIGHT NOW.

#### Stage 3: The Descent

Your fracturing sanity is starting to manifest visibly in everything you do. Your hands shake as you aim your gun, your eyes dart left and right when the silence becomes too strong, and you hear different words than those that are really being spoken by your companions. With a few personal mantras and focusing techniques you can bring yourself back into focus, but at this point, you’re doing them so much that they’re starting to lose their meaning and their effectiveness. Your friends are starting to whisper about you, and they cast each other dangerous looks when they think your back is turned…

**Empowerment:** The Mad Half can, if she so desires, randomly remove any one of your cards from your hand after they have been drawn and before they have been played. This must be explained by the Mad Half, however – your hands are trembling, you are sobbing too heavily, you’re seeing double, the chaos of the moment is just too much, etc. Also, your narrative price suggestions can be much more intense, and can now start to cross the lines of what might normally be considered acceptable standards of behavior and decency.

* *Cigarette Addiction:* When you’re done with that next smoke after this Showdown, you’re going to put it out on your arm.
* *I have to find my missing kids!:* You’re going to start talking to your companions as if they are your kids, and clean up their faces, straighten their clothes, etc.
* *Mindless Aggression:* Win or lose, you are going to break that bat you are carrying against a wall when this Showdown is over.
* *Obsessive about my Gear:* You are missing things that you could have sworn you just had a moment ago, and you must now search the area over again to find what you know you dropped somewhere.

#### Stage 4: The Shattering

You are one step away from totally losing it. Disembodied voices are talking to you, and you sometimes find yourself listening. You see flashes of loved ones, but you blink and they’re gone. You can picture yourself doing horrible things to your friends, but you shake your head and the images fade… for now. Anything can set you off, and it’s only a very, very short matter of time before you cross the line and shatter.

**Empowerment:** At this stage, the Mad Half can, at will, choose to narrate how you perform any Showdown. For example, if your intention is to “attack that zombie” and you declare you’re going to shoot it, the Mad Half can Interject, and instead say “No, you use your gun as a club instead and try to beat it” or “You flip the fun to full-auto and open the hose on the zombie, even though your friends are all around it as well.” This is in addition to the Empowerment from Stage 3. As for the Narrative Prices they can demand, they are now encouraged to blatantly cross the line of acceptable behavior, to the dangerously antisocial.

* *Cigarette Addiction:* While smoking, douse that house with gasoline, and when you’re done, flick your butt at it and then stand there watching it burn.
* *I have to find my missing kids!:* Your friends know exactly where your kids are and they’re keeping it a secret on purpose, so you should force it out of them.
* *Mindless Aggression:* When this Showdown ends you will be in a mindless rage. The very next companion of yours who speaks will be punched hard in the face!
* *Obsessive about my Gear:* Your friends are stealing your things, and you must get them back!

#### Stage 5: The Madness

When your mind succumbs to the Madness, you’ve pretty much lost it. At this point, you can still play your character (provide any Contagion effects don’t say otherwise), but be prepared to do some crazy messed-up stuff in the game, as your Mad Half takes free reign over any and all of your character’s actions, should you choose to try any. As long as you don’t engage in any Showdowns, however, you should be fine… or so you can try and believe…

**Special Limitation:** Once you have reached Stage 5 Madness, **you can *no longer Negotiate* for bonus cards!** You need to find a way to raise your stage of sanity before you can Negotiate again!

**Empowerment:** Whenever you declare an action, the Mad Half can declare that you do something else entirely different, if he so desires, and the sky is the limit here. Suggestions are likewise pretty heinous. This is in addition to the Empowerments from Stages 3 and 4.

* *Cigarette Addiction:* While you smoke that cigarette, set yourself on fire and laugh.
* *I have to find my missing kids!:* You’ve figured it out: your friends drugged you and convinced you to kill your own kids, so you must shoot them and then shoot yourself.
* *Mindless Aggression:* After this conflict, you have now lost all sanity, and will mindlessly attack anyone and everyone until they knock you out. Should you wake up, you’ll be back to your senses.
* *Obsessive about my Gear:* You don’t have enough pockets to hold your gear, so you should carve new ones into your thighs.

> **Price Example:** In our previous example, Hunter agreed to a pretty dramatic narrative price when Negotiating for bonus draws with Trin during a Showdown against Gruesome Henry. Fortunately for Hunter, he drew a Joker and came out on top, and Gruesome Henry’s brain-eating, corpse-screwing days have come to an end. Now that the Threats are all taken care of, Jian can set to the task of freeing his friends, who are currently trapped in one of Gruesome Henry’s famous Deadly Traps of Conflicted Morality. Doing such would be a simple matter of pulling a nearby lever and setting them free, but Hunter remembers his agreed-upon price, and decides this would be a wonderfully dramatic moment to bring it into play. He says: “Jian snaps out of his murderous rage, wiping the chunks of Henry’s skull off his sleeve, and remembers that his friends still need to be set free. But then an errant strand of hair falls into place, and he totally loses it. He starts pulling at it, and then pulling at the strands around it, yelling about how they’re not perfect, how they’re supposed to be gelled into place, how heroes are supposed to have perfect hair, and so on. He keeps pulling at his hair, ripping out strand after strand, until tears start to roll and he drops to his knees.”
> 
> Screg thinks this is a damn awesome way to end the scene, says “Scene!” and calls it there.

### What If I Can’t Pay?

If you’re already in the process of Negotiating, it means you’re obviously ready to take on a few more points of CGP. However, sometimes, you might find yourself unable to pay the narrative price demanded by your Mad Half. This could be due to unexpected twists in the scene, character incapacitation, or any other sudden change in the narration.

For example, you might agree to a price of “After this Showdown, you must grab a phone and try to call your missing girlfriend again.” However, if you lose this Showdown and, say, you are captured and immediately thrown into a locked cage with no phone in reach, then of course you can’t fulfill your end of the bargain.

In situations like the above, you may be prevented from fulfilling the actual details of your bargain, but you still must *try*, or somehow narrate your character’s inability to do so in a way that affects the story. In the above example, you could instead roleplay your character freaking out, screaming for his lost girlfriend, crying for a phone, and generally being upset about his inability to contact her. As long as the spirit of the price is the same, then you can alter the original narration a bit if it isn’t technically possible within the confines of the current scene.

### Keeping Track of your CGP Tally

You begin the game by taking the base rank of your **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cool</span>** Characteristic, adding +1 to it, and then writing that total on your CGP meter where it says “Points until Next Stage.” Look at the five stages, and circle the first one (“The Calm”) to denote that you have not yet begun your descent into madness.

Every time you gain a point of CGP during game play, start a tally next to the “points until…” number you wrote down. The moment your tally *exceeds* that total, erase the current tally, mark a single slash in a new tally (and record any additional CGP you might have taken in excess of that as well), and circle the next consecutive stage of madness. This does not need to be celebrated or otherwise enacted through any in-game event or roleplaying; the increased new scope of the Mad Half’s powers over you will take care of that nicely.

It is entirely possible to descend multiple stages of madness at once if you take large amounts of CGP.

### Losing Ranks in Cool

Whenever you lose ranks from your **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cool</span>**, you must also immediately adjust the “Points until next” field on your sheet accordingly. Compare the new calculated “Points until next” rank to your current tally of CGP points. If the new rank is greater than or equal to the tally, then no worries, mate. But if the new rank is *less than* your CGP total by any number of points, then treat it as if you had just gained those points, and adjust your Madness and Tallies accordingly.

### Reducing Your CGP

CGP can be reduced by by spending Survival Tokens between scenes. Likewise, you can rise up to a higher (read: less-crazy) stage of madness by spending those same tokens. Your tally can only ever be reduced to zero, though, and other means are necessary for actually reducing the current Madness Stage itself. See page 84 for more details.

## Other Uses of Madness

### The Panic Button

One of the powers of the CiC allows them to use the game’s setting to drive your characters crazy, without having to involve your Mad Half at all. The CiC can narrate any number of spooky, creepy, and downright frightening things into the scene, and if she so decides, they can rattle your characters’ bones and make their going all the more uncertain.

When the CiC decides to press the Panic Button, he must spend an Adversity token and then narrate the madness-inducing event that happens. Once narrated, every character takes one point of CGP, unless the event somehow directly relates to their character’s Psychotrigger, in which case the character takes two points instead.

Here are a whole slew of things that can drive the characters crazy:

* A person run over by a runaway truck in front of them
* A bomb suddenly drops next door, deafening them and shaking them off their feet
* A friendly ally is transformed by the infection right in front of their eyes
* A character watches her home explode from a cruise missile
* A wall collapses as a VW Microbus crashes through it into this very room
* The floor drops out from under them suddenly
* An eerie clicking begins to echo through the dark sewers
* Bugs and snakes start to flow in through holes and cracks
* All their torches are instantly blown out
* A horrible scream pierces the night, but is cut off by a sick, squelching crack
* They see the Big Bad for the very first time

Now keep in mind that any of these things can happen in the game without the CiC pressing the Panic button. Simple narration can be a wonderfully gruesome thing. However, simple narration of this kind won’t give your character CGP unless the CiC actually pays the Adversity cost to make it a Panic Button moment.

### CGP and the CiC

The CiC does not have a Crazy-go-Psycho meter, but can instead spend Adversity tokens to function as CGP points for his Bad Guys, letting them draw additional cards in Showdowns. There is more information on the Adversity Pool in the CiC section of the rules (see page 132).








# Part 5: The Cannibal-in-Charge

> “I can feel him lurking in dark  
> I can hear him walking in the shadows  
> Its not simple getting used to the slushies  
> I will guide him, through the fields of disposable heads”  
> 
> “Jesus Was a Zombie” by Zombie Girl”

## It’s Good to Be the King

Being the CiC is a lot of fun. As the Cannibal in Charge, you control all the basic nuances of the setting. You set the scenes which contain all the gameplay, and you control all the horrible things the characters will encounter. You have a lot of terrible power at your disposal to make the characters’ lives total chaos. However, your job is not necessarily to kill all the other players yourself, as convincing them to kill each other can be just as satisfying, if not more.

Being the CiC is not as hard as it may sound. You just gotta develop a good scenario, and if the players have a good dynamic, then they’ll do most of the work for you. As players in ***CC*** have a lot of narrative control, you don’t have to worry about coming up with too many story details. Let them take it where they find the most fun, and when they ask you questions about things, just make shit up as you go.

The keys to being a good Cannibal-in-Charge are:

* Knowing the Rules
* Playing Towards Your Players
* Properly evoking the themes of the game
* Developing a good scenario
* Setting good scenes (and the players can help with this!)
* Creating interesting non-player characters and Threats
* Effective management of the Adversity Pool

The first one is easy enough to master by simply reading this book. Most of the rules are contained in the previous chapters, but there are a few CiC-specific rules in this chapter as well, and you’d do best to learn them. They’re all pretty simple enough, and I’m confident that after a read-over or two, you should be able to reduce necessary in-game rules checks to a minimum.

As for the other keys, read on.

## The Players are the Most Important Key

Let’s face it: without the players, you’re just writing your own zombie-fic novel. With them, you’re all running and playing an awesome game of ***Cannibal Contagion***. You *need* them, and in most ways it is not *your* story, but *theirs*. As such, you should tailor your session so as to facilitate the maximum amount of fun for them.

Now, this is *not* to say that you should freely pander to their whims and lofty desires. After all, your job is to make the lives of the Survivors as close to a living hell as is within your whims and imagination. Your primary purpose is to make them suffer horribly, frequently, and embarrassingly. But remember, I said above that you’re supposed to try and make things fun. Suffering can be fun, right?

Wait, did you just say no? I’m amazed you even made it this far, with an attitude like that.

Still here? I must’ve misheard you then. Excellent! Keep reading for some advice on connecting with your players and putting together an awesome game of ***Cannibal Contagion***.

### Keep to the Same Page

It is *crucially* important that you make sure you and your players are all on the same page in every regard. At the beginning of your session, be it a con game, a living room game, or a pick-up game while waiting in line for the release of a new video game console or some concert tickets, you should take a few moments to let everyone know the kind of elements that will be in this session, so that the players can object or discuss, if necessary. For example, if you intend for your game to be gruesome and full of murdered children and zombie rape, then you should most definitely make sure that your fellow gamers in this session are okay with this before you start. ***Cannibal Contagion*** sessions can (and will, and have been) be host to some pretty messed-up ideas and happenings, and knowing the limits of your players is vital to helping them have fun.

But even further beyond the subject of offensive matters, it’s a damn good idea to make sure all the players have signed up to play the same game; matching creative agendas are as requisite as a deck of cards. If one player is looking for *Quarantine* while another player wants *Dead Rising*, then you can run into some clashing creative agendas if you just jump right in without a pre-game chat on focus and wants.

### Introducing New Players to the Rules

One of the biggest challenges of almost every game and system out there is the process of introducing new players to the game’s rules. Throwing a whole mess of unfamiliar mechanics at a new player all at once is usually a recipe for disaster, so I encourage you to take a measured approach to this situation.

When a new player joins your game, be they the only such player or be the entire table full of nothing but, I suggest that you skip a rules demo and character creation and just start playing. Start small, yes, but start playing right now. Give them a pre-made character or have them make one by random draws, and throw them into a new scene. Start with some open discussion and free-talking, get everyone comfortable role-playing the characters they have.

As the free-play goes, the players will ask questions about the scene, and you should answer each one negatively. Yes, you read that correctly. “Can I get through this door?” No, it’s locked. “Are there any weapons in there I can use?” No, not a one. “Can I pick that lock?” No, it’s completely unpickable. After a small handful of these, finally follow one of your responses with a statement along the lines of “…but, like most everything I decree, if you think your character can change it, then you should challenge me.” So now, when they next ask “Can I open this door?” and you tell them it’s locked, they should hopefully follow with “Then I’m going to pop it open with a hairpin and we’re getting out of here.”

Now you have your first Quickie. Show them how to play it out based on the situation at hand. Ask them if they think any of their Gear can help, and allow them to Activate it, but don’t bring in the Negotiation just yet. Once that’s over, and the conflict is bypassed, let them free-play some more and maybe try another Quickie or two, and then try throwing in an actual Threat – make it Fodder-grade, so they’ll think they’re bad ass when they defeat it.

“A slobbering zombie shambles towards you and bites your face off, and within moments you die and turn into one of them!” If no one reacts, remind them: it is *their* responsibility to challenge *you*. Hopefully, they’ll start to get the hang of things. Play out a Showdown, but once again, don’t bring in the Negotiation just yet. Let this one play out, and maybe throw in another Threat to make it more interesting. Now let them try and work together for a multi-player showdown.

Once the Threats are bypassed, end the scene, and go over the checklist. In the next scene, you should find that the players are taking more control of the scene, and that’s awesome. In your next Quickie or Showdown, tempt them with more power by offering them the chance to Negotiate. From that point, the rest of the game should hopefully just fall into place.

## Game Themes

Before we even begin to get into the rules behind your role as the Cannibal-in-Charge, let’s talk a bit about themes. If you haven’t already figured it out, ***Cannibal Contagion*** is a game about people trying to survive against an oppressive, nigh-overwhelming, infiltrating monstrous menace otherwise known as a Zombie Apocalypse. Sure, it’s also a game about going balls to the wall and totally massacring that menace in a variety of fun and hilariously morbid ways, but survival still plays a heavy role in both the premise and the rules. If you have spent any amount of time watching movies or otherwise enjoying stories of this genre of horror, then you’ve probably noticed a handful of themes that are pretty common to these stories. Desperation, paranoia, hopelessness, self-sacrifice, betrayal, might-makes-right, survival of the fittest, the terrible unknown, overwhelming stress, and even scattered bits of twisted and macabre humor.

A good game of ***CC*** will focus heavily on at least a couple of these major genre themes. The Survivors should be put into situations where their bonds of mutual trust are put to the test. They should be forced to play out conflicts which clash with their own morals. They should learn to take no possessions for granted, and to question their safety and survival at all moments. Even if you choose to focus mostly upon the humorous and over-the-top psychobilly aspects of such a threat, it is still next to impossible to run an effective game of Zombie Survival without taking some moments here and there to spotlight the desolate and oftentimes morbid aspects of the world around them. After all, *people are getting eaten by Zombies*, and no matter how cliché the idea has become in modern media, there is still something dark and primally sinister underneath that basic premise that is just impossible to ignore.

As the CiC, you should consider each of the major themes you wish to evoke in your game. Write them down in a corner of the scenario sheet where you can see them, and keep them fresh in your mind as you prepare and then eventually run your game. Before the game, take some time to consider each one, and how you plan on making sure it is present in your game. While running the game, be sure to not forget about them, and try to drop hints and threads of them into the story and description whenever you can. Well-implemented thematic narration and description can really impact a game session, and help the players all stay on the ball and have lots of fun. If you need some help or ideas with these themes, read more below. You might encounter some terms you haven’t seen yet in this text, but don’t fret it, it will all make sense once you’ve read the rest of this chapter.

### Betrayal and Paranoia

Working in betrayal can be really easy or really difficult, depending on the nature of the actual players at the table. I’ve played in some games where the players worked together like pros, and I’ve played in others where we couldn’t get much gaming in with all the inter-party bickering and back-stabbing taking the spotlight. If you’re the kind of CiC who likes party harmony, and your players agree, then don’t worry about this. But if you really want those players to be at each other’s throats, and you really want to work in the “Who can you really trust?” theme, then read on.

One of the best ways to encourage betrayal is to put it in play right at the very beginning, during the process of character creation. Encourage the players to make characters who by their very natures won’t get along at all, like Jocks and Nerds, or Cops and Thieves, or any such oppositions. If the characters know each other in advance, have them create Psychotriggers that clash with the other characters’ concepts and archetypes.

Once play has begun, make sure the players realize the mechanical rewards for directly and indirectly screwing over their fellow Survivors. Those initial player Secret Votes can help steer the players toward this, as they reward them with solid tangible character bonuses when they come true. Ramp up the narrative rewards for betrayal, as well. For example, have one player acquire some cool piece of loot, and then let everyone know how awesome it is so they can covet it. Encourage them to clash with their Mad Halves, and take out their aggressions in-game.

Throwing in some high suspicion can be rewarding, too. Pass notes to players that say little or nothing at all, or have monsters “mysteriously ignore” a certain character that you want everyone to suspect and hate. It can even be fun to have an in-game spy, one of the players who is on your side, sowing discontent and paranoia among the group. You can even turn this role against the planted player, by constantly passing *him* the notes so everyone suspects him rightly. Right or wrong, it can only work in your favor, and even if you end up totally selling out your plant-man, it still works out to fun for everyone in the end.

### Survival and Desperation

I hope that themes of survival and desperation are the least of your worries. If you have a high Threat Factor for your scenario, the survival aspect should be a piece of cake, as a near-constant deluge of enemies and threats should get that theme across without much additional effort on your part. When the players realize that their CGP meters are rising much faster than your Adversity Pool is depleting, they’ll either say “screw it” and just burn through their sanity, or conversely hoard their precious psyches for what they feel are crucial moments on the horizon.

If you really want to ramp up the survival, work those Gear Limits. Make them keep track of what they’re carrying and where, and have them try and figure out who is carrying what. They’ll have to decide what supplies are the most important to their survival, and plan ahead for future dangers. If they seem to be the types that leave their “slots” open for potentially better things, compound this by holding back on the loot in the game. Instead of giving them lots of useful things, make them scrape up whatever jury-rigged tools and supplies they can find on their own. Leave them up to their own devices, and grind down on their supplies. When they find themselves cornered in a basement with a horde of zombies closing in and only a wooden plank and a rusty prison shank to protect them, that’s when you know you’ve woven some effective survival themes into the story.

### Macabre Humor

I believe this should be the easiest theme to evoke. Gamers tend to have dirty gamer jokes crammed into all orifices just waiting to explode into the real world. I can’t count the number of games (pick a system) that I’ve run that have been paused or derailed by out-of-control gaming jokes and crass anecdotes, and I know I’m not alone in this. After all, most of us are here to enjoy some time with our buds, and it’s only natural that a lot of laughter and tomfoolery punctuate that camaraderie. ***Cannibal Contagion*** can be quite conducive to humorous moments, especially since the players are constantly encouraged to go over the top with their descriptions and one-up each other whenever possible. This zany, sick humor is intentional.

I’m not at all ashamed to admit this: Gamer Humor is one of my most favorite things in the universe, ever. However, from my many experiences, I know full well that game humor at the table has a tendency to get out of hand pretty quickly – it can be Contagious, so to speak. Unless you specifically want an all-humor, all-the-time kind of game, uncontrolled humor can be detrimental to the actual playing of the game. Sure, everyone might be having fun, but I’ve always been of the opinion that fun is *not* the only reason I’m here gaming with my friends. If I just wanted fun, I could do lots of things with The Crew that did not require the same amount of prep work, and make other plans with them that did not involve the pretense of gaming. Then again, ***Cannibal Contagion*** doesn’t really require all that much prep work, so of course your mileage may vary.

The key to evoking humor in the game is to keep it balanced with some seriousness here and there, and not let it derail the focus. I love it when funny jokes get suddenly turned into really creepy in-game moments, by either me or another player taking hold of the moment and twisting it. I remember my mom telling me ages ago “It’s all fun and games until someone loses an eye,” but in a game of ***Cannibal Contagion***, as far as I’m concerned it’s *more* fun when a character suffers the loss of limb and life as a result of something that was until just a second ago a mere joke. If you feel the game is being lost to some bit of uncontrollable humor, and you want to get it back in line, then take some element of the current joke and apply it to something grim and gruesome, and throw it right in the game.

If you want to see a good balance of serious themes and macabre humor, I recommend checking out the 2004 remake of the classic film *Dawn of the Dead*. There are some really fantastic moments in that movie where the line between comedy and tragedy is quickly and often unexpectedly crossed. I remember moments (no spoilers!) in that movie where I would be laughing at some line of dialogue, only to be shocked into fright by something really unexpectedly twisted, and vice-versa. Oh, and two words: *Zombie Baby*. Okay, I lied, that’s a minor spoiler.

But seriously, undead babies that crawl up your leg and eat you? Funny, but *goddamn* that creeps me out.

### Stress

The key to evoking a theme of stress is to constantly keep the Survivors moving. Throw a steady flow of danger their way, and keep the conflicts rolling. Don’t let them get more than a moment or two to catch their breath before you throw the next horrible monster or terrible catastrophe at them. Get used to the end-of-scene checklist, and move quickly into the next scene, kicking it off with another good explosion that starts the chaos all over again.

Here are some other simple tricks for using the mechanics to evoke stress:

* Hound those Juice checks, and when they’re becoming too reliant upon a certain weapon, try to get them to use it as often as possible and run out of Juice. As they run out of Juice, they’ll see their Showdown-winning options become fewer, and that is definitely a valid cause for stress. 
* Likewise, if you want to narrate that they begin the next scene with all of their Gear taken away, then do so! Keep in mind, though, that this costs Adversity Tokens. 
* Press their Psychotriggers frequently and heavily, and use the Panic Button as often as you can. Characters with high levels of Crazy-Go-Psycho points are just ticking stress-bombs waiting to pop.

## Scenario Development

When putting together a game of ***CC***, it’s imperative that you prepare a sweet scenario idea. The “scenario” is the whole premise of the game’s story and setting. Where does the game take place? What has caused the world to go mad?

When creating your own scenario, you will need to consider the following variables:

* Where does the game take place? 
* What is the premise of the scenario? 
* What is the *purpose* of this scenario? 
* What is the nature of the Contagion in this scenario? 
* What is the primary threat? 
* What roles will the characters fill in this story, and what goals do they pursue? 
* Are there any restrictions on the characters? 
* What is the game’s Threat Factor? 
* What important question will kick off the game?

### Setting

The first important variable is the setting, and the scope of that setting. You’ve probably noticed by now that ***Cannibal Contagion*** does not have a built-in world or setting. The rules were written as a universal set of mechanics for all kinds of monster-survival games, and as such I didn’t include any World History or fictional stories. This game is for *your* stories, and not just my own told vicariously through your imaginations. As such, you’ll have to take some initiative here and create your own setting.

Probably the easiest and most popular zombie survival stories will take place in the here and now. Just start with the town that you and your fellow players live in, and throw it in the middle of a Zombie Apocalypse. Imagine places you know personally being set aflame as looters riot and your Infected neighbors scramble to eat your flesh. Choosing your own backyard as the backdrop for your stories can really help keep all the players on the same page, especially if everyone is familiar with the locations the characters visit. It can also add to the atmosphere when they see their beloved hometown desolated and abandoned!

Of course, there is a nigh infinite amount of other setting possibilities. Does your game take place in a post-apocalyptic industrial wasteland, or maybe entirely within a single old warehouse within that wasteland? Are the characters on some strange island, or a traveling cruise ship? Perhaps a space ship lost out in the dead of the Great Black, with no power and no civilization for light years around? Are the characters running through the sewers beneath the city that the players already know and love?

Establishing a cool setting is crucial, as it lets everyone know a major focus of the game. Running through the stinking sewers will definitely have a different play feel than a posh cruise ship, for example. It lets the players know what the general environment will be, and gives them some idea as to how their characters will interact with it.

### Premise

Just what the hell is going on, anyway? Is there some crazy Bad Guy causing all kinds of horrid things to happen? Did some natural disaster open a weird portal to another dimension? Have demons infected the souls of the townspeople? Is an alien plague the source of all this chaos, and are the players now charged with stopping it?

The premise of your scenario gives you an idea of what is happening in the setting. It is not necessary at all to let the players know the secrets of your premise beforehand. In fact, keeping a lot of its intricacies hidden allows them to discover things as they play. You could even leave a lot of it totally unexplained at all, and have the characters only be exposed to a very small part of the Big Picture, if they get any answers at all. Suspense can be quite crucial to a fun game of ***CC***.

### Purpose

On the flip side of the same coin as the Premise, the Purpose of the scenario is just as important, as it lets everyone know what they’re primarily trying to accomplish. If the Purpose is “Escape from the Asylum” then all the players will know how to direct the game. The Purpose should be a simple statement of the scenario’s primary objective.

It’s important for you to let the players know the basic purpose of the scenario beforehand, as it will give them focus in how to proceed. A scenario with the purpose of “Survive for three days until help arrives” will be played a whole lot differently than one with the purpose of “Infiltrate the evil temple and destroy the lord of the undead.” In order to best facilitate the purpose of the scenario you have planned, you need to make sure the players are on the same page from the get-go. If you plan for a scenario in which the Survivors are supposed to keep running from the relentless cannibal horde and you fail to tell them this in the beginning, they could very well try and plan for a more “Kill them all and take their stuff!” style of play, which is not what you’ve likely planned for.

Once the characters are made, some of them may have personal secret goals that in some way clash with the scenario’s Purpose. It’s up to you to decide whether or not to allow clashing character goals. On the one hand, they could serve as a nice dramatic plot twist if played correctly, and can cause more oh-so-awesome conflict for the game. On the other, if abused, they could derail the game and ruin the fun of the other players.

### Contagion

Every scenario of ***CC*** should have a Contagion the players must deal with. The Contagion is one of the most important parts of this game, and without it, the game is really something completely different. The Contagion is the threat of infection and corruption that plagues the characters’ every action and decision. These rules give you a system for developing custom Contagions to suit your own games. Please see the Contagion section of the rules (see page 156).

### Primary Threat

What is the primary source of the characters’ adversity? What is the danger they face? The primary theme of ***CC*** is characters up against the zombie contagion. Zombies are fun, everyone loves them, and if you’re the type of person who doesn’t, well then I just don’t think we can be friends anymore and I would very much like my DVDs returned, thanks. But just having the zombies there might not be enough. Why are they there in the first place? Is some evil necromancer responsible for this, or are they here for no reason other than they just woke up one day and started eating people?

If the zombies aren’t the primary threat, what is? Demons? Giant Monsters? Robot Dino-Vikings from Jupiter? Is there even a primary threat at all? Do the zombies exist “just ‘cause” and that’s all we need to think about it?

### Character Roles

What purpose do the characters have in this scenario? Are they here just as fodder for the cannibal hordes, or is there some greater purpose to their existence? Are they trying to actively stop the threat, or simply escape it with their lives? Are they *part* of the threat?

Characters should also have their own individual goals to pursue. These can be as small in scope as getting in the pants of another character, or as grand as finding the secret of the contagion and using it to find a cure, or maybe just control it. Maybe one of them is searching for a lost family heirloom, and refuses to leave the carnage until it is found. Maybe one of them just wants to die a violent death and take as many of the monsters with him as her can. Goals are the most fun when they conflict with those of the other characters, and even those of the general setting.

### Character Restrictions

By this we primarily mean restrictions on character creation. Take the weapons, for example. If you’re running a scenario that takes place in ancient Japan, then it wouldn’t make sense for the characters to have machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. Then again, that could be pretty damn fun, now that I think of it.

### Threat Factor

The sole mechanical variable of the scenario setup process, the Threat Factor determines how much your Adversity will increase at the end of each scene of the game. The higher your Adversity, the more crazy things you can throw at the players. Use the following guidelines for establishing the Threat Factor of your scenario:

* **Slow:** For a game with a really slow and fairly easy buildup of danger, increase Adversity after every scene by an amount = the number of scenes that have passed. Some might consider this variable used by itself to be a sort of “Wuss Mode.”
* **Steady:** For a game with a steady and even (and predictable) buildup of danger, increase Adversity after every scene by an amount = the number of players at the table (yourself included).
* **Solid:** You can predefine a set number by which your Adversity Pool increases. If you want a slow-paced game with few Threats, set this somewhere from 2-4. For a game with a decent balance of Threat and role-playing, set it between 5-8. If you want all action all the time in a high-octane Threat-heavy game, set it at 9 or higher. **I recommend using a Solid Threat Factor if you are brand new to running the game**.
* **Unpredictable:** For a game with a random and unpredictable buildup of danger, increase Adversity after every scene by an amount based on a single drawn card. Draw a card and look at the suit, and then increase your Adversity by the following: Spades = 8, Hearts = 4, Clubs = 2, and Diamonds = 1. If you draw a Joker, consider it a Spade and then draw a second card, adding the results together.
* **Doomsday!** For games which are all about the gods-be-damned end of the world, the monster apocalypse to end all monster apocalypses, use *three* of the above Threat Factors at once (Slow + Steady + Unpredictable). Not only does this establish a large and steadily-increasing Adversity, it also includes a bit of random effect, *and* it lets the players know that the longer their characters survive, the more powerful their enemies will be. For experienced players of the game, I ***highly recommend*** using this as your default Threat Factor, simply because it tends to be the most fun. Also, if you are planning to only play for a couple of hours and a handful of scenes, this setting will get the action pumping fast and heavy.

You might want to hold off on setting this until after the players have made their characters. If the characters all have high ranks in **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kill</span>** and **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>**, you will find that they frequently overcome your Threats if your Adversity Pool is low. In such cases, should the characters all be “psycho killers” and the game be all about combat, then set a high Threat Factor.

When setting this, it’s important to keep in mind the Adversity costs of the Threats. Fodder Threats only cost a single token to bring in, and while they are easily dispatched, a lot of them can work together and really hurt the Survivors. On the other hand, a Bigger-Badder Big Bad costs sixteen tokens to introduce, and with a high Threat Factor you might find yourself tempted to do so too early.

### The Question

The very last step of character creation involves you asking each player a question that they must answer for their new Survivor. Their answer to this question will serve to frame their Survivor’s “Cold Open” Scene, which introduces their character to the game. You should write this down when designing your scenario, so as to remember it and give it some personal flair. Typically, this question should be some variant of “Where were you when the zombies first attacked?” Below are some other examples:

* Where were you when you first heard the news of the undead? 
* What were you doing when you first had a corpse try to eat you? 
* Where were you when the comet fell to the earth?

### Conclusion

Once you’ve got the above variables defined, you’ve got yourself the beginnings of a kick-ass ***Cannibal Contagion*** scenario. All that’s left is to get some players together and try it out as soon as you possibly can. Let’s hope it’s wicked fun!

### Scenario Ideas

On the next few pages you will find a small collection of predesigned stock scenario “little ideas” for you to read through, gleam ideas from, and even run yourself, should you find them suitable enough for your gaming needs.

#### Zombie Survival Scenarios

**The Zombie Apocalypse Is Now:** This is considered the “default” scenario for ***Cannibal Contagion***, simply because this is the primary theme behind most of the game’s core source material. Please check out the complete scenario after this section of the book for a fully fleshed-out zombie survival scenario using the four example characters printed and detailed earlier in these rules.

**Very Tragic Forest Battle Good and Evil for Fate of World Attack!:** A handful of seemingly-random strangers find themselves trapped in the same endless misty forest, trying to figure out why they’re there and why the dead won’t die. All the while, a powerful cosmic war across time and space wages subtly through their every action. \[Inspiration: *Versus, Wild Zero*\]

**Strikeforce Zero-Zero Badass:** A group of Special Forces are sent into a quarantine zone to discover the source of some effed-up ju-ju and neutralize it. Since these are super-badass Special Forces, they of course have swords, guns, and martial arts. After arriving, of course, the world goes to hell in a handbasket. \[Inspiration: *House of the Dead*, *Event Horizon*, *Aliens*, *Predator*\]

**Occupant Necrodanger:** The sinister Parasol Collective has developed a new virus, codenamed “The Z-Contagion,” and they’ve decided to use the remote Possum Town as their first major testing experiment. Your characters are stylish-yet-clueless members of the local R.A.T.S (Rural Assault Team-Squad) Special Forces country militia unit, and must find a way to stop the contagion from destroying your way of life (and taking your jobs). \[Inspiration: *Resident Evil*, *Redneck Zombies*\]

#### Zombie-Like Threat Scenarios

**Carnage Incarcerated:** You’re all in prison for various crimes great and small, and the world outside has gone craaaazy. Now you gotta break out. Good luck dealing with the zombified inmates, demon-ridden guards, and the murder fiends that now roam the hell-twisted halls of your prison. \[Inspiration: *The Suffering*\]

**Violent Hill:** You are a group of high school students on a road trip who have stopped in a shady mountain town for gas. While enjoying a breath of fresh air, the world goes nuts and you can’t leave the town. Oh, did I mention the flesh-eating demon-zombies that are trying to get you now? \[Inspiration: *Fatal Frame*, *Silent Hill*\]

**Attack of the Cybermandroidbotatrons:** People are being replaced left and right by replicants of a robot kind: the Cybermandroidbotatrons are invading! Watch out when you face these bastards – their guns infect you with nanobots which slowly take you over and turn you into one of them! \[Inspiration: *Star Trek*, *The Terminator*, *Doctor Who*\]

**Hollygrove:** So tell me if you’ve heard this before. You’re all at a party in downtown Big City when a giant effing monster attacks. Oh Noes! What? You want zombies? Okay, so the monster has little tiny monster friends that bite you and make you explode. There, how’s that? Oh yeah, spoiler alert. \[Inspiration: *Cloverfield*\]

**Starship Fearcraft:** You’re all in the Star Navy of the Galactic Alliance. While on a backwoods planet, you encounter a terrible alien scourge that threatens to take over your bodies and invade the universe. \[Inspiration: *Pitch Black*, *Aliens*, *Starcraft*\]

#### Something Completely Different

**The Emperor has Been Kidnapped By Ninjas:** Are you an Honorable Enough *Sama* to rescue the Emperor? In a steampunk-stylized ancient Japan, the Emperor’s most loyal guards discover that the Emperor has just been kidnapped by ninjas! However, the palace has just now been suddenly teleported to a wicked-evil dimension. The PCs must now battle their way through the undead, save the Emperor, and escape the palace alive. \[Inspiration: Every Japanese survival horror video game ever made\]

**Starvation Pass:** A small trading post in the Californian Mountains is trapped in by heavy snows, and the officers from the Civil War must hole up for the winter. Unfortunately, a sinister wendigo has hidden among their ranks, and soon, they will all be crazy cannibals! \[Inspiration: *Ravenous*\]

**Snakes in a Game:** Vicious, venomous reptiles have been let loose on a plane flying over the ocean! You must find a way to stay alive and beat back the horrible snakes while trying to land the plane and get its passengers to safety. \[Inspiration: *Snakes on a Plane*\]

## Scenes

To use an old cliché, the Scene is the basic building block of game structure in ***CC***. A scene is a chunk of in-game time during which we get a glimpse at something important happening in the game. Scenes usually involve the characters interacting with one another and the world around them, and in various ways. Maybe they’re exploring the ruins of a demonic temple, maybe they’re trying to find where the robot ninja zombies are coming from, maybe they’re trying to get a train to its destination while under attack from contagious hordes of cannibals.

The scene is where everything happens. Typically, scenes involve a lot of setting exploration and spontaneous narration. Players can ultimately push the scene in whatever direction they feel is appropriate. If players disagree on the flow of the scene, the Showdown mechanics allow them to contest their ideas.

### Scene Components

It is the CiC’s responsibility to establish new scenes. Every scene in the story has five major components that must be established when the scene is initially set up:

1. Who is there?
2. Where does it take place?
3. When does it take place?
4. Why is this scene important?
5. The Explosion!

First and most important: **Who** is in this scene? Are all the Survivors together in this scene at the beginning, or does this scene just focus on the experiences of one or two of them? What about other NPCs, like Allies and bady guys? Perhaps there are no Survivors at all in this scene, and it is instead a “war meeting” of the evil leaders only. Or perhaps there are no characters at all in this scene, and it serves only as something of a montage-like “let time pass” scene that shows the world slowly decaying.

The **Where** of a scene is obviously important, as it tells everyone where everything is happening. Are you in a locked storeroom of an abandoned warehouse, or maybe an open sunny field out in Happy (read: Boring) Land? Scenes should usually stay within the bounds of this setting, and they are usually concluded when the characters leave those bounds.

The **When** of a scene is equally important. If you like, you can easily skip the game around back and forth in time during its events. Entire movies have done this quite effectively, although I can’t think of any that also involved raging monster hordes. Most scenes will take place sequentially, but there is nothing saying they have to be back to back. Leaving a lot of “off-screen” time between your scenes can lead to some good dramatic highlights. Perhaps the characters end one scene just walking out of a church all peaceful-like, and the very next scene they start off running from a zombie horde through the bomb-blasted streets of London, an hour or so later.

The **Why** of the scene lets you know why the scene is happening in the first place. Do you want to showcase some new Bad Guy? Do you want to give the characters a chance to find some new gear? Do you want to give one or more characters some good moments of drama? Do you want to tie together some ends of the story? Do you want to murder one or more characters, or instead introduce some new ones? Deciding your purpose for the scene helps you guide it, and bring it to a close when that purpose has been fulfilled.

Finally, the **Explosion!** is my favorite part. Every scene in ***CC*** should start off with an explosion of some kind. Now, by “explosion” I don’t necessarily mean that you have to open every scene with a literal grenade blast or anything (although that would be goddamn cool, wouldn’t it!). I’m talking about solid, definite, scene-starting actions. Perhaps the scene opens right at the moment the door to the storeroom is kicked in, and then framed in the door is the silhouette of Vera’s shotgun-wielding, blood-soaked waitress, with the rest of the characters behind her. Or maybe the scene opens with a close-up shot of a zombie’s head right as it explodes, and it drops away and we zoom out to see the waitress has just shot him, and they’re all standing in a bright meadow surrounded by the corpses of the dead.

The explosion can involve a Showdown if necessary, but more often than not it is really fun to just describe the aftermath of a Showdown that was just concluded as the scene began, and then let the players take over from there. Instead of starting with Jian the Badass facing off against a Bad Guy, start with the moment that Jian’s sword removes said Bad Guy’s head. Starting a scene off with visceral gore is always lots of fun.

Of course, if you *do* decide to go the “grenades everywhere!” route, at least everyone will know *exactly* what this game is about!

### The “Cold Open” Scenes

In the television industry, the term “**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cold Open</span>**” is used to describe the scene that some shows use to kick-start an episode before the opening credits roll. These scenes often serve as preludes, setting up some important element of that episode’s story, and foreshadowing the events that are to come.

In ***Cannibal Contagion***, a Cold Open scene is used to introduce a Survivor and throw them into a world gone mad. Once all of the Survivors have been created, you should give each character their own unique Cold Opener. In this scene, you work with the player to answer the question you wrote down when you were first putting the scenario together. Typically this is some variant of “Where were *you* when the zombies first attacked?” Look at a player, ask the question, and use this scene to answer it.

Cold Open scenes are played just like other scenes, but tend to run a little shorter. Additionally, an Explosion isn’t always necessary to start one off. When you ask The Question, work with the player to decide where and when the scene happens. The Purpose of these scenes is almost always to introduce the Contagion and see how the Survivor reacts to it.

For each Cold Open scene, you should give yourself a total of four Adversity tokens. Use these to throw a Threat or two at the Survivor, and maybe to give that Threat some bonus cards. Start small – you don’t want to hurt them *too* badly during the Cold Opener, just shake them up and bit and prepare them for the horrors to come.

It is possible to have multiple Survivors in the same Cold Opener, especially if those characters are somehow related to one another in their concepts. For example, it would easily make sense to have the teenage brother and sister duo share the same Cold Opener, fighting off their father-turned-zombie and escaping their house together. Likewise, the boyfriend and girlfriend pair can be going at it hot and heavy when their zombie neighbors attack in their scene. Then again, giving such characters their own individual scenes can be fun too, as the boyfriend defeats his undead roommate and then leaves, driving off to find and rescue his girlfriend elsewhere in the zombie-infested city.

Once the character has survived the scene’s core conflict and decided upon some plan of action, bring the scene to a close. Aware the involved Survivor(s) the standard end of scene rewards. Once all characters have had their Cold Openers, each one should have the same end-of-scene rewards, as if they had each just finished a single scene of the game together.

Here are some ideas for some Cold Openers:

* The housewife hears a horrible noise from the next door neighbor’s house and runs to investigate. Once inside, she sees her neighbor is eating his wife’s intestines! After a quick fight, she runs out of the house and the scene ends.
* Dad gets a call that the kids are being sent home from school early due to a mass illness. When he gets there, a pack of zombie first graders attacks him! He stomps them, rescues his kid, and drives away, ending the scene.
* The shady guy is at the business end of a drug dealer’s gun underneath a highway overpass in the ‘hood. All of a sudden, a van flies off the overpass above them and crashes into the ground nearby, and zombies come out! The other guys are eaten, leaving the shady guy to deal with them or run. End of scene.
* Deke the space pirate is exploring a derelict ship, and on the bridge he encounters a shambling space captain (yarr, brains)! After defeating it, he notices that someone has just flown off with his pirate ship! Alone and poorly-armed, he ventures into the derelict’s depths to find a way to activate it and get out of here. End of scene.

Once they’re done, it’s time to start the game *for real*.

### The “First” Scene

After the characters have all had their Cold Opens, it’s time for the “First” full-group scene of the game. This scene should bring the characters together, if they haven’t already been introduced. In this scene, the characters more deeply explore the basic premise of the game, get to know each other, and maybe get some supplies before the chaos *really* begins. The characters should explore this scene, probe and prod the story in the directions of their choice.

It is not always necessary to start the first scene with an Explosion. If the CiC wants to start slow and introduce the cannibal threat in a later scene, an Explosion might be pretty counter-productive to that intended feel if used too early in the game.

If the characters don’t know each other yet, or are not together, the first scene should focus on them exploring the beginning of the story and guiding it towards their eventual meeting. “Getting the band together” can make for some great game moments, especially if the characters have to fight through creepy cannibals and other nasties in order to do so. If Carla’s Cold Open involved her getting off work late at night and running away from “some creepy homeless guy,” and Roger’s Cold Open involved him getting pulled over for speeding by a *very* sick-looking cop, then perhaps the First scene should involve the two of them meeting at just the right moment, as they are both pursued in a downtown park by a handful of crazed cannibals.

In some games, the first scene will start with the characters already in the middle of things. The monster threat has already been revealed in the Cold Opens, and now the characters are somehow conflicting with it. If the CiC started the game with a lot of Adversity, he might choose to just jump on in swinging, throwing all he can at the players to put them on their toes and keep them there, right from the get-go.

### Ending Scenes

The CiC should make sure to keep a watch on the flow of the scene, and call for its end when he feels it is most dramatically appropriate. Some scenes will just end naturally, while others might require a little meta-control to close.

In most cases, a scene should conclude when the primary purpose of that scene has been fulfilled. If the scene was established to accomplish some in-game motivation, it should come to a close shortly after that motivation is either met or failed. If at any point you can sit back and be unable to figure out what the purpose of the current scene’s goings-on is, then it is probably a good time to steer it towards a close. Make in-game and/or out-of-game insinuations or outright suggestions that the players move towards closing the scene.

To end a scene, just hold up your hand and say “and, Scene!” while dropping your hand back down. This is how I’ve seen it done on several scene-focused improv comedy shows and events, and I think it’s just cool. It really gets the point across. When concluding a scene, go through the following quick End-of-Scene Checklist:

1. Increase the Threat of every surviving player character by +1 (record on the CiC sheet).
2. Increase the Survival Pool by +1 for every Survivor and Ally still alive.
3. Ask if any players wish to spend Survival tokens to recover character aspects and buy Gear.
4. Check for possible Infection and Turning (see below)
5. CiC increases Adversity Pool by the scenario’s predetermined Threat Factor.
6. Finally, once they’re done, give them more Survival tokens = their **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** rank plus the number of scenes that have passed (these cannot be spent until the *next* scene begins)

For ease of in-game reference, a much-condensed version of this checklist is also printed on the handy CiC cheat sheet, included with the player sheet in the back of this book.

### Player-Introduced Scenes

Here’s an idea that’s a lot of fun: have the *players* frame the scenes. When a scene is over and it’s time to start a new one, look at the players and ask them if they’ve got an idea for a cool scene. “Okay guys, what happens next?” Let them work together to come up with the Where, When, Purpose, and Explosion, or have them each submit their own idea separately. When players submit good scene ideas that then become new scenes, reward them with one to three bonus Survival tokens.

### Scene Example

Here’s an example of the basic flow of a scene in a game of ***Cannibal Contagion***:

> Screg opens the next scene with Carla, Jian, Roger, and Mei Li all together, running for their lives. Hunter (Jian’s player) suggests that the scene should take place in an abandoned bomb shelter, and Screg agrees, giving Hunter a bonus Survival Token for the great idea. The scene takes place an hour after their last one, which ended with Carla, Roger, and Mei Li being saved from a pack of rabid ghouls by a motorcycle-riding, guitar-swinging Jian. The Why of the new scene is to allow them to explore a bit more of the desolation of the environment and make some plans, while hoping the horde doesn’t somehow break through into their shelter.
> 
> Screg opens the scene with an Explosion: giving the wheel one last full-strength spin, Roger and Jian seal the inner bulkhead door to the bomb shelter. The locking bolts slam into place with a screech of metal and rust, while heavy pounding on the outside lets them know that the cannibal horde is still out there, hungry for their flesh. The players now take over.
> 
> Carla has lost a little bit of her sanity at this point, and immediately starts crying about her kids (due to a narrative price her Mad Half previously demanded that she was unable to pay in the previous scene). She is emotionally kicking herself for not finding them yet, and collapses into a sobbing heap in a corner. Mei Li tries calming her down, but Vera (Carla’s player) says that Carla is just too lost for the moment. But there’s a zombie horde trying to get in, and everyone knows it’s only a matter of time before they find another way in. Roger screams at Mei Li to “shut that crazy bitch up!” Mei Li, always cool under pressure, keeps trying. Trin (her player) decides to challenge Vera’s intention to have Carla keep crying. Trin says that Mei Li is going to try and break Carla out of it, so they make it a Showdown between Trin and Vera – both characters using their Savvy. Trin wins, and succeeds in calming Carla down and bringing the waitress back to her wits.
> 
> Jian assesses the situation. Screg says sorry, there’s no escape, but Hunter calls shenanigans and says no, Jian’s going to find a way out of here that doesn’t involve A) the way they came in or B) their collective deaths. Screg lets Hunter turn it into a standard Quickie, using Jian’s Savvy. Jian wins, but had to negotiate with his Mad Half and take a few points of CGP in order to achieve Success. Hunter says that Jian finds a way into the sewers below the city, via a carefully-concealed hatch in the floor. This could potentially save their lives!
> 
> Roger, meanwhile, is trying to scrounge up some supplies. Screg says the place is completely barren, having been abandoned years ago due to the decline in national fear of nuclear attack from the Commies. Karo (Roger’s player) believes he can find something, so Screg agrees to another standard Quickie, using Roger’s Savvy. Roger easily wins, and Screg says that he finds a heavy fire hydrant (2 slots), a box full of 20 MREs (each MRE would take 1 slot), and a flashlight (1 slot). Roger takes them into stock.
> 
> They put their heads together to work on a plan. Screg decrees that it’s hard to concentrate with the steadily-increasing pounding of the horde outside, and spends an Adversity Token to make that a Panic Button moment, giving them all a point of CGP. Unperturbed by this, they carry on planning, and quickly decide to try and reach a nearby police station through the sewer tunnels.
> 
> Jian opens the hatch to the sewer and they all drop down. Waiting for them at the bottom is a crocodile monster! The monster bites the head off the first person that drops down – Jian, in this case. Hunter objects to this of course, so he and Screg play a Showdown. Jian barely wins, avoiding getting his head bitten off. The others drop down and all four of them join in a multi-player showdown against the crocodile monster. They manage to bring it down after a couple of full-table hands are played, but Mei Li is badly hurt – and unknown to the rest of them, Mei Li is also now infected! They run forth into the darkness of the sewers, Roger now leading the way with his newfound flashlight.
> 
> Screg ends the scene by narrating that they all hear the sound of the bomb shelter door above them bursting open, accompanied by a cacophony of snarls as the horde pours in. “And… scene!”

## Conflicts, Threats, and Adversity

One of the most important jobs of the CiC is to provide challenges and obstacles for the players to overcome – in this game and many others, we call these challenges and obstacles **conflicts**. The ***Cannibal Contagion*** mechanics provide two major tools for you to bring in mechanical conflicts: **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Threats</span>** and the **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Adversity Pool</span>**. In ***Cannibal Contagion***, any force that actively works against the Survivors is called a Threat, including zombie hordes, plant-creatures, rioting looters, trigger-happy soldiers and more. In order to introduce these Threats into a scene, the CiC uses a fluctuating pile of tokens called the Adversity Pool, spending tokens to purchase the presence of these menaces into the game. These two systems work hand-in-hand to help you provide constant and engaging challenges for your groups of players to encounter. Whether they can survive these challenges, however, is up to them.

### The Adversity Tokens

The CiC has a collective Adversity Pool with which to challenge their players. This pool of tokens gives them the power to forcefully insert danger into the lives of the Survivors by inserting Threats into a scene, among other things. The Adversity Pool increases by a pre-set amount determined at the beginning of the game (the Threat Factor). As the scenes go by and the Showdowns are played, this pool of tokens will fluctuate wildly, gaining and losing tokens frequently. The current size of the CiC’s Adversity Pool can serve as an effective tool for foreshadowing, allowing them to guess just how much potential pain might be sent their way in the not-too-distant future.

During a game session, the pool is most often used to introduce new Threats. It can also function as CGP points for the Threats, allowing the CiC to spend a token in the same ways a Survivor would gain a point of CGP, with no Negotiation required. See below for a full list of the various Adversity token uses in ***Cannibal Contagion***:

* Use to purchase new Threats and bring them into the scene. The costs vary depending upon the Threat’s Role. 
* Use a token to re-introduce a *previously-introduced but undefeated* Threat from an earlier scene.
* Increase the Threat Score of an introduced Threat on a one-for-one basis. This can only be done at immediately after the Threat has been introduced *or* when the Threat is re-introduced into a later scene.
* Use a token to active a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Panic Button</span>**. See the Mad Half section (see page 104) for more details
* Use to draw bonus cards for any in-scene Threat with a purchased Threat score. 
* Use a token to attempt a soak check when a Threat is hit with Hurtin’. This is handled as a standard Quickie, but uses the Threat’s Hand Size (determined by Role) in place of **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>**. Don’t forget this! If the Survivors are beating your Threats down too easily, make some soak checks! 
* Use to take away a Survivor’s Gear between scenes. Do this *after* they have spent their tokens to purchase new Gear. The cost is 1 Adversity Token per Gear, and 2 per custom weapon.

When initially setting up a game, determine the session’s Threat Factor. This number sets the amount by which the CiC’s Adversity Pool (see below) increases at the end of every scene. The CiC starts the game with an Adversity Pool set by the numerical value of a random card draw, and she can increase it in-game using the following methods:

* Can be increased +1 for each face or ace exchanged in a winning play pile, and +2 with a Joker.
* Increases by the scenario’s Threat Factor at the end of every scene.
* Increases by the Survivor’s current Survival token stash when the CiC kills that Survivor.

### Understanding Threats

As the CiC, you are responsible for the introduction and management of all the *non-player* characters and enemies that stand beside or against those played by the players themselves – in other words, all the background characters that fill out the scenes of the world that you and your players create. Allies have already been covered previously in the rules, so in this section we’re going to focus on the forces that actively stand against the Survivors. These could be terrible man-eating zombies, twisted alien overlords, or just masses of fodder for the Survivors to mow down with bullets.

In ***Cannibal Contagion***, we call these enemies <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Threats</span>. Whether they are upset neighbors, corrupt cops, zombies, giant effing monsters, naughty succubus librarians, flesh-melting aliens or whatever, they’re all Threats, and the rules for handling them are the same. It is your job to portray these Threats as best you can, and play their conflicts when the time arises.

Before we go any further, let’s talk about the differences between “non-player characters” and actual Threats. If you have played other role-playing games, then you are probably familiar with the ways in which non-player characters (usually called NPCs) are usually handled. Other games tend to give these characters the same stats and mechanics as the regular Player Characters (which we call Survivors). Frequently, creating NPCs in these games can take just as long as creating the actual player characters, if not longer. ***Cannibal Contagion*** simplifies this greatly.

In ***Cannibal Contagion***, all characters that are not directly controlled by the players – meaning, all non-Survivor characters – fall into one of three categories: **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Allies</span>**, **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wallflowers</span>**, and **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Threats</span>**. The previous chapter already detailed the use and mechanics of Allies. Basically, they are advanced types of Gear that have personalities and a bit more autonomy (see page 76).

Wallflowers are characters who have no direct mechanical impact in the current scene. That weird crazy street vendor who sells the Survivor a Glock is a Wallflower, as are those poor sods you just described being eaten alive by the zombies that the Survivors just accidentally stumbled upon. They can be quite important to the flow and the current narrative, and can have rich and detailed personalities, but they have no mechanical sway in Quickies and Showdowns. Ultimately, Wallflowers exist only at the allowance of the players’ and the CiC’s narrative whims. The CiC can narrate their deaths or other such elimination at any time, and the players can do so as well through the use of successful Showdown narration.

**Wallflower Examples**: Creepy Bag Lady, Marv the Pharmacist, Chewed-upon Severed Leg \#24, that sleeping guard over there, the cowering cashier at the Grab-and-Dash, etc.

Threats, on the other hand, are the bad guys. They represent the forces that directly oppose the characters, the challenges that the Survivors must overcome. They are bought and introduced into scenes using the Adversity rules, which are defined further below. These fellas have two major in-game mechanical descriptors, called **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Role</span>** and **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Threat</span>**, which they use to directly participate in Showdowns against the Survivors. Because they were paid for with Adversity tokens, Threats can only be eliminated through the use of Showdowns and Hurtin’. Just like the Survivors, they have a potential to directly change the scenes and mechanically conflict with other characters. Any group of monsters that the CiC wishes to throw at the Survivors falls into this group.

**Threat Example**: The rotting walking corpse that used to be your mail man, a pack of hungry hounds, Murderous Deke, the hungry hungry hobos, a knife-wielding psychopath, rioting townspeople, etc.

It is also possible for characters of one type to change into another type. For example, an Ally who gets really pissed off at a Survivor could very well become a new Threat. At any point in a scene *not* during a Showdown, the CiC can “upgrade” an already-introduced Wallflower or Ally character to full Threat status using the Adversity Pool. Doing so uses the normal Adversity rules, and the character is purchased like any other Threat would be. And of course, a Survivor can transform into a Threat via the Infection rules (see further below).

#### Threat Scores

Any character – Survivor *or* Threat – that is somehow considered important in the game has a Threat score. Threats use their Threat score as their single all-purpose Characteristic, and the CiC uses it as a gauge to determine how super nasty the Survivors will be when they eventually succumb to the Infection, die, or both.

Important Threats in ***CC*** use their Threat ratings as a sort of “hit point” tally. When characters win in Showdowns against Threats, any Hurtin’ they cause is taken directly from those Threat Scores. Unlike normal Hurtin’, this does not in any way impact the Card Draws of those Threats. Threats are handled just like other characters for purposes of elimination. It is important to note that if a character is in a scene and he does not have Characteristic scores or was not paid for with Adversity tokens (meaning: he is a Wallflower), then he can be killed at any time by narration. Only Survivors and Threats *require* Hurtin’ to be eliminated.

Every Survivor also has a Threat score known only by the CiC, which starts at zero and increases by +1 every time that character survives a scene. By “survive” we mean “ends the scene still alive.” The Survivors’ individual Threat Scores mainly exist as a bit of foreshadowing: the higher a character’s Threat, the more dangerous they might eventually be. Should your Contagion’s aftermath involve Turning, then this Threat score is the basis for the Turned character’s power as a Threat.

#### Introducing Threats

When bringing new non-player characters into the game, you have to determine if they’re going to be important in the scene (they are Allies or Threats), or if they exist only as color (they are Wallflowers). A random street vendor might not be that important, and will be unlikely to exist as anything other than color. Chances are, he won’t even be an Ally, and will just be there for descriptive purposes of the scene. A gun-collecting nutjob who hunts down the characters for trespassing on his land, however, will likely be quite important, as will a pack of cannibals trying to eat them, or the mad doctor trying to infect the world with his demon plague. These latter folks are Threats, and here are the rules on how to bring them into play.

Every Threat in a game of ***CC*** has two major attributes: **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Role</span>** and **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Threat</span>**. The Threat attribute was described in the previous section, but Role is definitely a new one. Every Threat introduced in the game needs to have a defined Role, which gives it a purpose in the scene and sets the number of cards it draws in Showdowns. There are five pre-set roles for Threats in **CC**: Fodder, Hindrance, Miniboss, Big Bad, and Bigger-Badder Big Bad.

When you introduce a new Threat into a scene, you must pick what role it will be and then pay the associated cost in Adversity tokens. A Threat’s role determines how many tokens it costs to introduce, what cards are used to determine its Threat score, and how many cards it gets to draw during Showdowns. Each role uses a variant of the same mechanic for determining initial Threat scores, which involves drawing a card and keeping its value as the Threat score. Once you’ve determined the Threat score, you can then choose to spend more of your Adversity tokens to increase that Threat score on a one for one basis. If you are using the optional Threat cards to keep track of your Threats in the game, you can keep the Threat card and the drawn card next to each other for ease of reference in play.

It is important to understand that the Threat score does *not* necessarily indicate the number of characters being introduced. The actual number of in-game characters in a group is entirely irrelevant to the mechanics, and is mostly just a matter of dramatic flavor and scene description. For example, you can introduce a dozens-large pack of expendable zombies as a single Hindrance-grade Threat with a low Threat score if you like, or you can introduce a single super-zombie badass with a really high Threat score. Likewise, you can introduce a group of “police sharpshooters” as a single entity with a single collective Threat Score, as their actual composition doesn’t matter to the mechanics – what matters is that there are sharpshooters ahead, they are a single Threat, and the Survivors must overcome that Threat. In any case, when an entity’s Threat is eliminated with Hurtin’, the entire group is narrated out of the scene.

A good example of this is just about any movie where you have bad-ass heroes fighting against massive numbers of enemies which you would normally expect to be grossly overwhelming. My favorite instance of this is in the movie *Kill Bill*, the end of which had The Bride going solo against the entirety of the Crazy 88 Yakuza army. If that were a game of Cannibal Contagion, the entirety of the Crazy 88 would have been introduced into the game as a single entity. An easy way to sum up that entire prolonged battle would be with a single Showdown, with the hero fighting against a Hindrance-level Threat. That Threat would represent the entire Crazy 88 group, and seeing as how she barely took a scratch during the fight, the Threat would probably have low a Threat Score.

Printed below for reference and ease of understanding are the quick steps for introducing new important Threats into a scene:

1. Pick the Threat’s Role.
2. Spend the Adversity tokens, based on Role.
3. Draw card(s) to determine Threat Score, based on Role.
4. Jot the stuff down and Play!

> **Example**: Screg has amassed a veritable arsenal-grade stockpile of Adversity tokens over the last couple of scenes, and now that he has the players thinking the road ahead is going to be easy, he’s decided to destroy their hopes and dreams by unleashing the cannibal hordes he’s been holding back for just this moment. As the players are scrounging for some ammo in a pawn shop, he decides that when they exit, the monsters will attack. He starts preparing his Threats for that encounter.
> 
> Screg chooses to have the players get jumped by two groups of contagious shamblers and a single super-cannibal at their lead. For the two groups of shamblers, he sets their Roles both at “Hindrance,” which costs him two Adversity tokens each. He draws a single card for each to determine their Threat scores, getting a King and a five. He writes down that Group A has a Threat of 13 while Group B only has 5. Each also gets three cards in any Showdown.
> 
> Next he jots down the info for the Miniboss-Role super-cannibal, who he has decided shall be named Big Karl. Screg draws for Threat – Minibosses get two cards, keep the highest, so Screg draws a two and a four. Keeping the Threat of 4, it looks like Big Karl might not be so tough after all. Screg decides that BK needs to be a bit beefier, so he spends four more Adversity tokens to directly boost BK’s threat Score to 8.
> 
> In the end, he’s spent eleven Adversity tokens to throw these bad guys at the players (2 each to play the shambler groups, 3 to play Big Karl, and another 4 to boost BK’s Threat). Let’s hope the heroes can survive the onslaught that awaits them outside the store!

#### Threat Roles and Costs

Below are descriptions of the five core roles for Threats, along with the costs in Adversity to introduce them, the methods for determining their starting Threat Scores, and their Hand sizes when participating in Showdowns.

##### Fodder

Enemies of the Fodder role always play Showdowns with *two* drawn cards. These are the pus zombies that explode in nasty messes when kicked, the rapid tree sloths that drop from above to slightly menace your journey, and so on.

Adversity Cost**: 1**

**Starting Threat**: Draw two cards, keep the lowest.

Showdown Hand Size**: 2 cards**

##### Hindrance

Enemies of the Hindrance role always play Showdowns with *three* drawn cards. Most cannibal hordes will probably be in this category. Enemy soldiers could fill this role too, and policemen, saboteurs, guardsmen, footmen, etc.

Adversity Cost**: 2**

**Starting Threat**: Draw a single card

Showdown Hand Size**: 3 cards**

##### Miniboss

Enemies of the Miniboss role always play Showdowns with *four* drawn cards. Minibosses are the enforcers of the Big Bad, or possibly the Tough Guys of the cannibal hordes. These are the super-orcs that stand a head above the rest, the intelligent zombies that use shotguns and drive jeeps.

Adversity Cost**: 4**

**Starting Threat**: Draw two cards, keep the highest.

Showdown Hand Size**: Four cards**

##### 2B: Big Bad

Enemies of the Big Bad role always play Showdowns with *five* drawn cards. These fellas are the end-of-game “boss” monsters, the mad scientists and evil necromancers and crazy Nazis that started all this crap. These are the guys the characters might fight in the Big Final Showdown, should they even make it that far.

Adversity Cost**: 8**

**Starting Threat**: Draw three cards, keep the total of the highest and lowest.

Showdown Hand Size**: Five cards**

##### 4B: Bigger-Badder Big Bad

Enemies of the 4B role always play Showdowns with *six or more* drawn cards – you should decide upon the amount when you introduce the Threat. These are the bosses of the end-session bosses, the “I’ll bet you thought it was that guy but really it was *this* guy the whole time!” bosses. They’re the dark overfiends from the nethers that are here to doom the world, or the Ultimate Creations of the mad necroscientist that grew too powerful and turned on their creators. These guys should be nigh impossible to destroy, and have lots of tricks up their sleeves. 4B Threats are *not* meant to be balanced, either – once the Survivors face off against the final boss, it’s up to them to figure out how to defeat a foe which clearly outclasses them.

Adversity Cost**: 16**

**Starting Threat**: Draw four cards, keep the total of the highest two cards.

**Showdown Hand Size**: Six or more cards – you should decide upon the amount when you introduce the Threat.

#### Special: Turned Characters

The rules for re-introducing previously-introduced Threats and Survivors that have been Turned by the Contagion are found in the Contagion section (see page 165).

#### Infected Threats

It is important to note that there is no additional cost for introducing Threats that already carry or are Infected by the game’s Contagion. You are entirely free to deem which Threats are Infected, or what other nefarious abilities and powers they might have.

#### Equipping Threats

Threats can use Gear and Weapons just like the players can, so when you introduce them, don’t forget to outfit them! Having riot cops without riot gear makes no sense, for example.

#### Using Threats

Important Threats use their Threat Score as if it was a Characteristic like any other, and it serves all purposes. Threats that would take Hurtin’ and other Characteristic loss effects lose points from their Threat score, and when Threat reaches zero or less that character is defeated. If an enemy is purchased into a scene but it is not defeated during that scene, the Adversity tokens used to purchase it are lost, but the Threat is set aside and can be re-introduced to a future scene for the cost of a single Adversity token. The CiC can choose to use any amount of Adversity as he chooses. The CiC can even choose to let multiple scenes pass without dipping into the Adversity Pool at all, letting the players get more paranoid as he builds his stockpile of Horrible Things to throw at them.

#### Making Threats Memorable

Threats don’t have to be all stats and numbers, mind you. You should take care to make your Threats memorable above and beyond their mechanical attributes. Give them personalities, accents, quirks, and goals within the scope of the scenario. I’ve found that using the Random Archetypes tables in the back of this book can be great for coming up with quick instant Threats (and other characters, too) on the fly when necessary.

#### Other, Possibly Greater Threats

Zombies are awesome, but why stop there? The ***CC*** rules are designed to allow you to role-play mad crazy survival against mad crazy monsters. Zombies obviously fit that bill, but you can most certainly include different threats as well or instead. Perhaps the enemies are people possessed by demons, and you have to find a way to clear them out without killing the people. Perhaps there is a wide variety of enemies, each with different motivations, dangers, and weaknesses. Some may do different types of damage, some may even affect the players’ cards and CGP meters.

Below are some examples of alternate Threats you can use in ***CC***, and of course you are encouraged to create your own.

##### Alternate Threat: Murder Fiends

As the Survivors try to escape from the now demonic prison, they are attacked by various types of monsters, each representing a different form of murder or punishment. The most common of these are the Blade Demons, vaguely-humanoid conglomerations of barbed wire, chains, and blood-encrusted rusty blades. When used in the game, they utilize the standard Threat rules, but their attacks do not Infect. Instead, they simply have more powerful natural attacks. With Murder Fiends, any aces or faces in their draw pile *automatically* do an additional point of Hurtin, cumulative with the normal Hurtin’ rules.

##### Alternate Threat: Madness Spirits

While trapped in the archaic ghost-town of Violent Grove, the characters encounter the hate-twisted spirits of the long dead, driven mad by their centuries trapped between the veil of life and the great hereafter. These spirits do not Infect with their attacks, but instead cause Crazy-Go-Psycho points to build up. Like Infection, each successful attack causes a point of CGP, and aces or faces can be exchanged to cause more.

##### Alternate Threat: Giant Effing Monster

Oh, c’mon, you know this one. A Bigass Ugly Thing (TM) has attacked Tokyo, the city that is obviously located at the very center of the whole frickin’ universe. This monster is the size of a skyscraper, and it’s got a buttload of little monsters in tow. When the little buggers bite ya, you get Infected as normal, but instead of eventually turning into a cannibal, you just explode and take out everyone else around you. This would initiate a multi-player Showdown, with the CiC playing the exploding character, using a hand of cards equal to the character’s current Threat score. Involved characters should, of course, try to get the hell away, because should the CiC win, that’s potentially a lot of Hurtin’.

Oh, and the monster itself? If you’re even going to *give* it stats at all, it should be no less than a 4B ranked Bad Guy, and have a crap-ton of cards and an astronomical Threat. I mean, c’mon, it’s a Giant Effing Monster. What else would you expect?

##### Alternate Threat: The Threateners

The vile lords of Ur’Vraal have blessed their most powerful archons with the spiritual keys to the gates that lead to their twisted dimension. These archons are the vanguard of the Ur’Vraal’s invasion force, and can call in more minions from beyond those gates at their instant whim. Known as “Threateners,” these archons can exchange *any* Hurtin’ they generate in Showdowns to directly increase the CiC’s Adversity, or even directly increase the Threat of any Ur’Vraikiil Reaver Mobs present in the scene.

##### Alternate Threat: Soul-Dampeners

Far on the edge of town stands the Blessed House of Saint Patros, a shelter and halfway-house for the destitute and those down on their luck. The sisters there are beloved in the community for the efforts they have made in cleaning up the streets. However, these ladies hide a sinister secret: they feed upon the wills of the individuals who some to them, *stealing* the life force of these unwitting innocents for nefarious purposes. As they hurt you, they heal themselves! Each face or ace they generate in a winning Showdown recovers a point of Threat *and* hurts the player with Hurtin’.

#### Sample Threats

Below is a collection of sample Bad Guys for use in your scenarios. You can use them freely, or if you like just skim them over to get a feel for some creative takes on Threats, and get some ideas for your own special enemies.

##### Craw-Dads (Fodder)

The first attempts at field-testing the Z-Contagion were done in an underground lab underneath Swampy the Frog’s Happytime Amusement Park on the outskirts of Possum Town. In these darkened corridors, the scientists of the Parasol Collective tested the first strains of the Contagion by injected it into crayfish which, obviously, escaped and killed everyone. Now these mutated and highly Infectious critters skulk in the murky ditches that border every single road in Possum Town, and are a major annoyance to the Survivors.

Adversity Cost**: As Fodder**

Starting Threat**: As Fodder**

Showdown Hand Size**: As Fodder**

**Special**: Infection

##### Goddamned Crows (Fodder)

While they aren’t infected, the Goddamned Crows are perhaps the single most aggravating foes that can be encountered after the zombie apocalypse. The tension in the world has driven them insane, and they now dive-attack any who step within their marked territories, often attacking in murderous swarms. They’re relatively easy to pick off, but trying to do so can seriously deplete your Juice.

Adversity Cost**: As Fodder**

Starting Threat**: As Fodder**

Showdown Hand Size**: As Fodder**

**Special**: Goddamned Crows are a special kind of pain in the ass Fodder. Goddamned Crows are purchased as normal Fodder, but once the Threat score is determined, it represents that number of unique Threats with a single-point Threat score each. Like Fodder, you pay a single Adversity token to introduce some Goddamned Crows, and then you draw two cards, keeping the lowest to determine Threat. If you drew a four, for example, then that means that you now have four separate one-point Threats that the Survivors must now deal with.

##### Ugglies (Fodder)

“Ugglies” are a nickname given to the nameless face-stealing flesh-made spirits of the Ur’Vraal. These cursed souls are so despised by their masters that they are not graced with actual names, and the nickname here is only applied by humans who have been fortunate enough to survive encounters with them. The Ugglies are regurgitated souls deemed unworthy by the Ur’Vraal to serve any purpose other than eternal wandering, and they are as such filled with Hate, and nothing but. Their forms are hideously twisted visages of their former selves, and when attacked by one, you can feel them trying to suck your own faces and spirits through their malformed nostrils, desperately trying to eat your beauty and make you one of them.

Adversity Cost**: As Fodder**

Starting Threat**: As Fodder**

Showdown Hand Size**: As Fodder**

**Special**: Although only Fodder, Ugglies are very dangerous. When a Survivor is hurt by an Uggly, the Hurtin’ *must* come first out of **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>**. If the character has no more **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>**, only then can the rest of the Hurtin’ be applied as the player sees fit. Also, the Ugglies don’t infect, but if they kill you, you will Turn as one of them.

##### Possessed Villagers (Hindrance)

The remote mountain town of Saavosk has been overrun by dark spirits, released into this world by a mad hedge sorcerer’s rituals. The poor villagers have become possessed by the Hatchers, foul netherfiends who use their minds as birthing-food for their twisted emotional offspring. The Hatchers use these folks as their vessels, protecting the village while their babies incubate within the very souls of the possessed. All the while, the spirits of the villagers are conscious, watching themselves perform horrid acts of murder and cannibalism while their puppeteers set to work.

**Adversity Cost**: As Hindrance

Starting Threat**: As Hindrance**

Showdown Hand Size**: As Hindrance**

**Special**: If the Survivors are directly involved in Showdowns against Hatcher-possessed villagers, they are tormented by the visions of pain and psychotic suffering seen within the eyes of these poor victims. Regardless of who wins the Showdown, after it is over, each involved Survivor is hit as if affected by a Panic Button. This does not cost the CiC an Adversity token to evoke, either!

##### Churchematicians (Hindrance)

Having been converted by reading the soul-eating pamphlets of their horrible leader J. Don Throbblesquarp, the sinister legions of the Order of Churchematics crawl forth from corrupted urban centers, equipped with nothing but smiles and stacks of “informative brochures.” While they themselves don’t put up much of a fight, they tend to travel in groups, and you should beware their horrible pamphlets.

**Adversity Cost**: As Hindrance

Starting Threat**: As Hindrance**

Showdown Hand Size**: As Hindrance**

**Special**: Infection. Churchematicians can infect with any successful Showdown, regardless of combat or without any Hurtin’ dealt to their enemies, as their Infection comes not from injury but from pamphlets.

##### Advanced Shamblers (Hindrance)

In just about all ways, the Advanced Shamblers are your basic zombies. They travel in packs and feast upon the flesh of the living. Most of them just stumble around slowly, but some have retained an advanced level of motor control over their legs, and can keep up with a jogger with no problem. Others have held onto some vestiges of the skills from their former lives, and can use certain tools to their advantage – although mostly, this usually consists of pumping gas and hitting things with garden tools.

**Adversity Cost**: As Hindrance

Starting Threat**: As Hindrance**

Showdown Hand Size**: As Hindrance**

**Special**: Infection, limited Gear usage

##### Bouncing Betties (Miniboss)

One of the more sinister results of Cykosys, the Betties were first created when pregnant human women became infected by the alien techno-plague. After a particularly traumatizing transformation process, these women were “reborn” as the horrible bladed automatons we have since come to nickname “Bouncing Betties.” They are extremely fast, moving with near-blinding speeds in pursuit of their designated targets, which they slice to thousands of grisly shreds with a vast array of retractable blades. What’s worse, upon incapacitation their nanites set to repairing their damaged components, and within only a handful of minutes they rise fully-rejuvenated to continue pursuit.

**Adversity Cost**: 5 tokens (see special)

Starting Threat**: As Miniboss**

Showdown Hand Size**: As Miniboss**

**Special**: Unless destroyed by acid, Betties will return to play fully-restored after each defeat. They do not display this regenerative power during combat; their repair mechanisms only kick in after they are incapacitated. Each minute afterwards, one point of their Threat Score is restored, and once fully restored, they return to the game and continue their pursuit. This return to play does not cost tokens, but because of this power they cost an additional token (5 total) when introduced. Betties do not Infect, they only destroy.

##### Schlock Troopers (Miniboss)

These special Super-zombies were created by an evolved strain of the Z-Contagion. The test subjects infected with the new strain showed more versatility in movement and motor control, and stronger levels of offensive capabilities over their more degenerate predecessors. They are also more receptive for behavior conditioning treatment, and have so far made excellent “brute squad” enforcers for the Parasol Collective. They are capable of using a limited array of high- explosive heavy firearms, and they wield skin-grafted melee weapons when cornered. As an added “bonus,” all victims cut by the blades of these entities will be infected by a sub-strain of the same virus, and eventually become Advanced Shamblers themselves.

Adversity Cost**: As Miniboss**

Starting Threat**: As Miniboss**

Showdown Hand Size**: As Miniboss**

**Special**: Infection, Can use weapons. It is suggested that Schlock Troopers enter play with weapons doing +3 Hurtin’.

##### The Rictus Riders (Miniboss)

This hardened crew of motorcycle-riding miscreants travel the ruins of urban areas, slaughtering zombies and taking prisoners to sell into the new slave markets. They are known for vicious acts of rape and brutality, and should not be taken lightly. You should only negotiate with them if you can clearly display that you have the upper hand.

**Adversity Cost**: As Miniboss (they usually travel in packs)

Starting Threat**: As Miniboss**

Showdown Hand Size**: As Miniboss**

**Special**: The Rictus Riders are armed to the teeth, and should be equipped appropriately.

##### The Hive (2B)

The Hive is the massively grotesque spawning portal for the Insekkt Invasion. Created from the corpse of an infected human host, this gigantic mound of flesh and chitin exists only to create more of the alien fiends, which shed their birthing jelly and fly out to continue the invasion of Earth. Better destroy it quickly, however, because it has a remarkable ability to speed its monster-production when under stress.

Adversity Cost**: As Big Bad**

Starting Threat**: As Big Bad**

Showdown Hand Size**: As Big Bad**

**Special**: Threatener. The hive does not attack at all. It can initiate non-violent Showdowns, and the players can react to it. If the players do not engage it at all, then it can perform Quickies every few minutes of real time. Each face or ace adds to your Adversity pool.

In Showdowns, the Hive does not cause Hurtin’. Instead, with every Showdown it wins, *all* Hurtin’ generated is instantly converted to Adversity tokens, to be immediately spent adding lesser Threats to the scene, spawned from its grotesque innards.

##### Captain Murder (2B)

Keith Granger was once a mild-mannered accountant in Blossom Falls, Idaho. He lived a simple life, paid his bills on time, had some drinks with the fellows after work on Casual Fridays, enjoyed an occasional military reenactment game, and lived with the company of an assortment of small household pets. Then one of those pets got infected with something alien, and bit him while he was feeding it. A few extremely painful days later, Keith ceased to be, and Captain Murder stepped from the ashes of Keith’s old house. Wearing the ripped clothes of a World War II naval captain, he rides a gigantic horse across the countryside, murdering folks he encounters who break some disturbing moral code that we haven’t yet deciphered. A veritable one-man (one-thing?) army, if you see the silhouette of him astride his horse in the far horizon, you should quickly move fast in the opposite direction.

Adversity Cost**: As Big Bad**

Starting Threat**: As Big Bad**

Showdown Hand Size**: As Big Bad**

**Special**: Infection, Special Regeneration. Any faces or aces drawn in Showdowns can be used to restore lost Threat ranks on a one-for-one basis.

##### The Pastamancer (4B)

When the horrible Linguini Monster was set upon the world, and the shelves of every grocery store pasta aisle revolted against their centuries-old oppression by their human masters, the Pastamancer was behind it all. Secretly disguised as a helpful Survivor, the heroes don’t realize the true terrible identity of the Pastamancer until it’s too late, and they’ve blown their Crazy-go-Psycho Meters trying to take down the Rigatoni Monster they had mistakenly identified as the Big Bad. Beware the Pastamancer’s Infectious pet Noodlings! Don’t let them crawl into your brain!

Adversity Cost**: As 4B**

Starting Threat**: As 4B**

Showdown Hand Size**: As 4B**

**Special**: Infection, Special Threatening. The Pastamancer can sacrifice any amount of his Threat score to create Noodlings. Each point of Threat sacrificed creates a unique 1-Point “Noodling” Threat of Fodder role, with the special power of Infection.

##### Gilbert Souther (4B)

Gilbert Souther was once Commander of the RATS force in Possum Town, but decided to betray them to the Parasol Collective in exchange for access to a special serum that turned him into a super-zombie. Somehow he became a vampire instead, and is really sensitive about the subject. He has since climbed the political ladder at Parasol, and now runs all their operations from the shadows (of his coffin, that is). He is to be considered a threat more dangerous than any other.

Adversity Cost**: As 4B**

Starting Threat**: As 4B**

Showdown Hand Size**: As 4B**

**Special**: Gilbert Souther is a special type of enemy called a “Mary Sue.” He cannot ever be killed by the direct actions of the player characters, no matter how much Hurtin’ they give him. To defeat Gilbert Souther, the players must come up with a completely ridiculous, off-kilter, “deus ex machina” idea that occurs somehow through their successful Showdown narration. CiC, keep in mind that only the most ridiculous thing will succeed, so make them work for it. Otherwise, Gilbert will be back in all the sequels, and only be more ridiculously strong.

#### Non-Combat Threats and Showdowns

Not all Showdowns have to be combat-focused, and not all Threats have to be terrible bad guys. The Threat mechanics can be used to introduce non-character menaces into the game, indirect challenges that will more frequently require guile and the **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** Characteristic in order to overcome. Showdowns can be used to play out any number of dramatic conflicts with these Threats.

Below are some examples of other conflicts which can be played out via a Showdown, and the Threats that might be faced in them. The Threats in these examples can be purchased and introduced like any other Threat. Overcoming them in conflicts will often require indirect action and cleverness beyond the usual “shoot until it’s dead” that fixes most issues.

**Diffuse the Viral Bomb!** For this Showdown, the Bomb would be a Threat of most likely Miniboss role. A showdown against the bomb could involve the player(s) using their **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** and technical resources to either diffuse it completely or simply delay its countdown to explode. Should the bomb win, well, good bye, heroes, and welcome to the world of the infected. When the Bomb “steps it up,” you could have its timer start spinning down, technical lockouts and short-circuits could hinder the players, foreign interfaces could confuse the, etc.

**Get through the collapsing hallway before the lava fills the room!** Here the Threat is the Lava itself, of either Hindrance or Miniboss role, depending on how powerful a force you want it to be. The players could use Kill to try and rush past it or kick down the door out of the hallway, **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** to try and divert it or help their fellows through safely, or anything else along those lines. Should the lava win, it bursts through and floods over the Survivors, burning them extensively. When the Lava “steps it up,” it could collapse new sections of the wall, spout up from the floor, burst down from the ceiling, and so on.

**Defeat the Malfunctioning Supercomputer!** The Supercomputer is the Threat this time, most likely as a Big Bad role bad guy. It possesses all kinds of traps and gadgets and attack drones it can throw at the Survivors. They will soon find that attacking the drones is pointless, as they just keep coming endlessly. The Survivors will have to use Kill to damage its power sources, and Savvy to bypass its controls.

**Get the sailboat through the terrible storm!** In this conflict, the players have escaped the infected island on a sailboat and must make it through a storm to get back to land. The storm would be a Hindrance or Miniboss Threat, and would have all manner of crashing waves, violent winds, and lightning strikes with which to assault the Survivors. As the Survivors take cover in the boat, direct the sails, and shift their weight on board, they can draw some cards and maybe make it through the storm.

**Get past the Deathtrap Cube!** The Threat here is the Room itself, of Miniboss or Big Bad role, full of traps and dangers intended to murderize the Survivors in as grisly a way as possible. Survivors can use **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kill</span>** and **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** equally here, as some traps can be dodged and brute-forced, while others require insight and preparation in order to bypass. Each time the Room steps it up, it could throw another trap at the Survivors, drop blades from the ceiling, manifest invisible razor wires, and so on.

In summation, any type of challenge or opposing force can be introduced as a Threat with some creative thinking. Play around with different ideas and see what you can come up with!

#### Conflicts Without Threat

In fact, not all dangers in ***CC*** have to be purchased with Adversity, have Threat scores, or even involve Bad Guys at all. As the CiC, you should feel free to throw all sorts of non-Showdown dangers and challenges at the Survivors. The best challenges are those that force the characters to make decisions about their survival, and even better are those that challenge their morals, ethics, and attitudes about the quality of their lives and those of their friends and families.

Introducing these challenges is as simple as narrating them into the game at your desire. If you want a careening car to charge the characters frantically from the highway they’re walking down, then just say it and see how they respond. If you want to have the building they’re hiding in collapse around them, then do it. It’s not only your right as the CiC to keep the players on their toes, it’s your *entire mission*.

When using non-Threat challenges, feel free to force the players to make various Characteristic Quickies, and use their results to determine what happens as a result. Successful draws should work in their favor, while unsuccessful draws should be detrimental to their actions, safety, survival, and/or goals. But don’t just throw them a challenge and immediately ask them for a Quickie to bypass it. Make them think about it first. They’ll need to be able to offer some kind of valid way to resolve the challenge before using the cards to see if their ideas succeed. Remember that the cards are there to supplement the narration and role-playing, and not to replace them. If the players don’t have any ideas on what to do, then it’s their loss. Even the most pathetic and seemingly-doomed ideas are at least something, and could very well work.

Remember: as the CiC you are entitled to do just about *anything* with pure narrative authority. You can make buildings collapse, meteors fall from the sky, grenades magically materialize out of thin air, swarms of locusts scour the countryside, and more. **As long as your narration does not mechanically impact the Survivors (via changes in Hurtin’, CGP, or what-have-you), then you are free to change the environment to your heart’s desire, without any requisite expenditure of Adversity tokens, introduction of Threats, or challenges for Showdowns**. However, if the players feel they can directly change the situation, then it’s time to turn the danger into a Threat and let them overcome it with a Showdown.

Also keep in mind that there are far worse things you can do to the Survivors than just Hurt them. It’s a good idea to make sure the players realize this, too. Sure, mechanically screwing with a character can limit his ability to “succeed” in play, but so can any number of purely narrative effects. If a character fails to dodge that speeding car, narrate that his leg is now broken. Sure he won’t take Hurtin’, but he’ll have to find some other way to get around, and that will directly affect the story. If a giant magnet in the ceiling activates unexpectedly, the Survivors might not get hurt at all, but their metal weapons (and piercings and jewelry and belts and so on) will be taken from them. But again, remember: **if the players challenge it, and their characters can make a difference, then it’s time for a Quickie or Showdown. Purchase the Threat and let the cards have the final say**.

Here are some ideas for ways to introduce conflicts without using Bad Guys:

* An out-of-control vehicle is coming their way, and fast! Dodge quickly or break your legs.
* The roof is collapsing on them! Anyone caught underneath it will be unconscious and require medical attention to bring back into play.
* Their car is on fire, and will explode any minute now! This could be a Showdown
* A terrible skittering sound begins to gain in volume, almost deafening the Survivors by the time the source arrives: a veritable sea of frightened vermin, running toward them and obvious trying to escape something more dangerous in the darkness beyond. Don’t get pulled under by the vile tide!
* A grenade explodes near a character, dropped by an unknown party. Shrapnel buries into the character’s leg, liming their ability to run.

#### Alternate Solutions

Something I highly recommend considering is that not every fully-purchased Threat need to be defeated directly via Showdowns. In some cases, consider allowing alternate solutions to your Threats – solutions that involve just a simple Quickie and a clever bit of applied narration. Take a page from the *Resident Evil* series of video games. Like many survival horror games, each game in this series features crazy boss fights spaced periodically. However, a common element to each game is that many of the boss fights can be handily tipped to the player’s favor, if not avoided entirely, with a bit of exploration of the setting and clever application of some game elements. By taking an extended play detour and combining some special herbs, for example, a certain plant boss in one of the games can be defeated without firing a single bullet.

In your game sessions, if the players come up with a good way to bypass a Threat without directly conflicting against it, consider skipping a Showdown and letting them simply pull a Quickie or two instead. If they succeed, the Threat doesn’t have to be completely eliminated, but it could be taken out of the current scene, and kept out of play for an extended duration. Plus, bringing those Threats back later at key moments of crisis can lead to some truly memorable game play!

## Contagion

As the game is played and the crap flies around, there is a good chance one or more Survivors will become Infected with the Cannibal Contagion. When the nasty monsters bite you, chances are, you will get the sickness, and it’s only a matter of time before friends become not just enemies, but ravenous man-eating cannibals. This should be a core feature of every game of ***Cannibal Contagion***, as many of the rules revolve around it. This system of entirely personalized and customizable contagious infection is one of the big things that makes ***Cannibal Contagion*** different from a lot of other zombie-themed games.

### What is the Contagion?

Just what is the nature of the Cannibal Contagion in your game? Is it just a “simple” matter of the dead refusing to stay dead, coming back from the great beyond to eat our brains? Is it a maddening disease which, while otherwise nonfatal, causes people to go permanently and viciously insane, attacking and killing everyone they see? Perhaps the Contagion is a breed of mutating alien parasites which use human bodies as food and host for its horrible larvae? Or maybe it’s just a disease which kills everyone and everything, causing mass deaths of biblical proportions?

When you are putting together a scenario for this game, you should define the exact nature of the Cannibal Contagion, and choose which mechanics it will use in your game. Creating the Contagion is simply a matter of setting up five special variables that define how it fits mechanically into your game.

#### Contagion Variables

The five important mechanical variables you must define are the **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vector</span>**, the **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Effects</span>**, the **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Threshold</span>**, the **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aftermath</span>**, and the **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Antidote</span>** of the Contagion.

##### Contagion Vector

The Vector of the Contagion determines the mechanical side of how the Survivors might contract it.

**Environmental**: Something in the world around the Survivors is Infecting them. Perhaps there’s a corrupted water supply causing all of this, and anyone who drinks it turns into a cannibal monster. Or maybe the Infection is spread by an airborne virus! The simple act of *breathing* is now dangerous to their survival. The characters should gain Infection after each scene unless proper precautions have been arranged (such as gas masks). Or perhaps the Infection is spread by weird insects. These insects are never introduced as a directly-combatable Threat, but as an ever-present danger that the characters must somehow protect themselves against. Randomly let them know they’ve been bitten, and let them react. (Example: *Cabin Fever*)

**Physical Contact**: With this Vector, the Contagion is spread through the bites/claws/kisses/licks/etc of infected opponents. You’ve seen the movies: if a zombie bites you, you’re pretty much a goner unless something *extremely* fortunate comes your way. In your game this could be any narrative method you desire: bites, claws, venom, saliva, slime, blood – whatever it is, the mechanics are the same. With this Vector in play, when you lose a physical-based Showdown against infected foes *and* take at least one point of Hurtin’ (*before* any <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span> checks are drawn to reduce Hurtin’), your opponent immediately gives you one point of Infection, and can choose to exchange aces or faces in the pile to give you more. It is up to the CiC whether or not you can try to resist it (see below). Multiple points of Infection are cumulative, and the tally totals for each character should be recorded on the CiC’s sheet. (Example: Zombie Bites)

**No Reason!**: If the Vector is set to No Reason, then everyone in the game is already infected. There is no cause, it just exists and now you have to deal with it. This is useful for games with a more Romero-like feel, where *everyone* becomes a zombie when they die, without any real explanation. You know, Hell has no more room, and the dead just walk the earth. This type of infection cannot be resisted! (Example: *Night of the Living Dead*)

**Right From the Get-Go:** For a fabulously-awesome twist in the way the game is played, have the characters all get infected before the game even begins! The game could open with them all waking up wearing hospital gowns inside some weird compound, and they’ve got band-aids on their arms from a recent hypodermic injection of some sort. Or instead, open the game with some kind of subtly baited statement, such as “Your company just took you out to a delicious and unexpected breakfast of scones and tea. Out of curiosity, how do you usually take your tea – one lump or two?” Any players who don’t specifically say “I didn’t eat any scones” start the game with Infected characters. Combine this with one of the above Vectors so you can infect the others later in the game!

##### Contagion Effects

The Effects of the Contagion determine what mechanics are in place while the Infection is inside the character, up until the point of the Threshold (see below). Each of the choices below has different effects that must be considered at different times in the game, so I advise you make sure you are fully familiar with the rules of the Effects variable your have chosen.

**Debilitating**: If the Contagion is Debilitating, at the end of every scene the infected characters each take an amount of Hurtin’ equal to their current individual Infection tallies. Remember: once your Characteristics all reach zero, you’re dead! (Example: The George Romero Zombie Movies)

**Incubating**: If the Contagion is of an Incubating variant, then their Infection tally steadily increases at the end of every scene. The CiC makes a Quickie for each Infected character, using their current Infection Tallies as the Characteristic in the test. Each Ace or Face drawn increases the Tally by +1. Thus, greater levels of Infection only serve to multiply themselves. (Example: *Aliens*)

**Maddening**: Characters infected with a Maddening Contagion steadily increase in Crazy-Go-Psycho points instead of Infection tallies. Once Infected, they gain points of CGP at the end of every scene – one for each scene that has passed since becoming Infected, including the scene of Infection. Meaning, at the end of the first scene of Infection they gain one, then at the end of the next scene they gain two more, and then three, and so on. (Example: *28 Days Later, The Signal, Serenity*)

##### Contagion Threshold

The Threshold of the Contagion sets the point at which the infection permanently sets in, transforming the character into a different creature altogether. Once the Threshold has been reached, the Aftermath mechanics set in. The CiC should use this variable to determine just how much time the character has left in the world of the living and/or sane.

**Death**: If the Threshold is death, then the infection fully takes over when the character dies. (Example: George Romero Zombie Movies)

**Madness**: With this setting, the Threshold is crossed the moment the character descends into Stage 5 Madness, or in the following scene if such happened between scenes. (Example: *28 Days Later*)

**Random**: If the Threshold is random, then the CiC makes secret Quickies for each Infected character at the end of each Scene (use the Infection tally). Any aces or faces drawn mean that the character will cross the Threshold at some point during the next scene. Either work it out with the player privately, or just announce it when the time comes.

**Threat Cap**: If the Threshold is set to a Threat Cap, then the character crosses the Threshold when their Infection Tally *exceeds* their current Threat Score.

##### Contagion Aftermath

The Aftermath of the Contagion decides what happens after the Threshold has been crossed. When an infected character passes the above-defined Threshold, you should apply the mechanics of whatever you have chosen for your Contagion’s Aftermath.

**Explosion!**: When the Contagion’s Threshold is crossed, the character explodes (and dies, of course). Everyone nearby takes Hurtin’ equal to the character’s Infection tally at the time of their death. This can be resisted by **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>**, and if the CiC so decides, the explosion also infects anyone it hits. Talk about a dirty bomb! (Example: *Cloverfield*)

**Just Plain Death**: Once the Threshold is crossed, the character is immediately dead. There’s no threat of them coming back or anything, just death. Perhaps they’re really the lucky one, right? (Example: Any historical plague of epic proportions)

**Turned**: Once the Threshold has been crossed, the character has <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Turned</span>, and become entirely under the power of the Contagion. In your game, depending upon your own Contagion this could mean they are a shambling corpse, a vile alien metamorph, a necrotically-evolved super-zombie, a fully-possessed demon shell, an uncontrollably enraged psycho killer, or whatever you so decide. Either way, the rules are the same: the character is now re-introduced as a Threat. Read on further below for all the juicy details. (Example: Zombies & Aliens & more!)

##### Contagion Antidote

Can the Infection be delayed or cured in your game? That’s what this variable sets. If there’s a possibility for an Antidote, define it here. Does the antidote cure them, or only slow it down? Will everything be turned back to normal if the source of the Infection is discovered and cleansed? Maybe there really isn’t an antidote at all, but everyone believes there is and they’ll spend their whole time searching for one, only to die horrible ignoble deaths. It could definitely happen. I recommend for a truly tense game that you not let the players know how you defined this variable; even if there is no cure, they might think there is, and it could make the role-play pretty awesome!

The Antidote variable determines not only if the infection can be cured, but also if it can even be resisted at all.

**Mind Over Matter**: If Mind Over Matter is in place, then the Infection can be resisted with natural abilities alone. This is good news for the players! Each time the character is set to take Infection, you (the CiC) should tell them so, and offer to let them try a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** check to resist it. Each Ace or Face they draw resists one point of incoming Infection. Don’t tell them how much, though, and only give them a vague idea if they succeed or not. Keep asking them if they want to Negotiate to draw more cards, too – they’ll rack up the CGP if the threat of Infection is upon them! Note that if the character was not previously Infected before this Showdown, he remains un-Infected if he can reduce the incoming Infection to zero.

**Only Delays the Inevitable**: If the Antidote only delays the inevitable, then the player has to keep track of a supply of special expendable Gear (pills, serum, special food, human flesh, etc) that keeps the infection from rising. This gear is special in that it can *only* be Sacrificed, and it can only be used on **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** checks made to resist the Infection. The mechanics function just like the Mind Over matter option above, but with two changes: 1) the player *must* have one or more units of the special Gear in order to attempt the check, and 2) the Infection prevention is only temporary, and any prevented Infection must again be resisted at the end of the next scene.

**Destroy the Source**: The Contagion can’t be eliminated until you find and destroy the source of the infection. This could be a super-vampire, a master zombie, an alien hive queen, or any other sinister Alpha Source of the infection. This enemy should most definitely be of the Bigger-Badder Big Bad role, although it could be fun to make the players think that the mere Big Bad they just fought was their actual nemesis.

**MacGuffin**: There is theoretically a cure, but it isn’t something the Survivors can mechanically apply during this scenario. This could be some special serum that has no mechanical effect but serves as a major plot point of the game’s narrative. The Survivors could have a special cure with them the whole time, but no way to apply it, with the game’s desired outcome involving them spending all their efforts trying to find a way to use it.

**None!**: There’s no cure! Tough luck, bro. Of course, you *don’t* have to let the players know this…

##### Choosing Your Contagion’s Variables

When designing your Contagion, go through the options presented above and choose the variables most fitting to your needs. You should select at least one for each of the five variables, but you’re not necessarily limited to only one for each. Many of the variable options can easily work in harmony. For example, if your Contagion has both Incubating and Debilitating for its Effect variables, then it will not only hurt the Infected character, but the pain it causes will only increase drastically over time.

#### Infection Tallies

Several of the variable options for your Contagion mention keeping track of Infection Tallies. The printable CiC sheet has a spot on it where you can keep track of each player’s Infection tallies, should you use them in your game. I personally suggest keeping the Infection scores a secret, to build more suspense and tension at the table. After all, if Sam knows that Jake’s character has a certain level of Infection, what’s to stop Sam from taking action on that knowledge and having his own character just take out the poor sod before he turns? Keeping the tallies a secret allows more moments where the players act purely on paranoia and suspicion. Let them fight amongst themselves as they worry over who will get infected next!

#### Turning

In many ways, the scenario’s Contagion can be a far more dangerous and despicable enemy than any Threats the CiC throws at the Survivors. Many of the Aftermaths listed above have the word “<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Turned”</span> as part of the Contagion’s final effects. When a character has Turned, it means they have become a dangerous monster of some sort, and that *usually* means they are now a Threat. Allies, Threats, and Survivors alike can both be equally affected by the Contagion and Turning, and the rules on how to handle this are printed below.

##### Turned Threats

Okay, let’s say you used some Adversity tokens to introduce this awesome Threat, say, a really hard-ass riot cop who is there to beat him down some errant Survivors, teach ‘em who’s boss and not to give him no lip, that kinda bad ass. And let’s say this riot cop gets totally greased by said Survivors, eliminating him as a supposed threat. But let’s also say that before this riot cop gets whacked, he gets Infected. Finally, let’s just assume that in your game, folks who get Infected and die will quickly come back as turned cannibals.

So how do you handle this Threat? He was already paid for by Adversity and defeated fair and square by the heroes, yet the Contagion in your game decrees that the dead come back to life, so what then? In such a case, the Contagion trumps, and the Threat comes back as a murderous zombie monster.

Here’s how it works. When a previously-introduced Threat turns, it can only return to the game by being re-introduced (and re-purchased) as a new Threat, using the standard mechanics for doing so. If you are curious to know why the turned Threat must be re-purchased, it is because essentially, the character is now a brand new threatening menace that must be defeated again. The only difference here is that in being re-introduced, the new Threat adds their old remaining Threat score (at the time of Turning, if any at all) to their newly-drawn one. This is because in almost every circumstance, the newly-transformed cannibal-thing is far harder to take down than the original guy. Now, if the Threat was killed before the Aftermath set in, then of course there will be no previous Threat score to add in, making the new beast-thing a bit easier to kill. But if the Turning happened before the Threat’s death, oh no! In such a case, you can either narrate the Threat out of the scene to re-introduce later with the rules above, or instantly pay for the new Turned Threat

**Adversity Cost**: Same as new chosen Role

**Starting Threat**: Equal to the Threat Score of the character at the time of their Turning, plus the normal Threat draw for the purchased Role.

**Showdown Hand Size**: Same as new purchased Role

##### Turned Allies

When an Ally is subjected to the Contagion’s Vector, draw a card. If it is an Ace or Joker, the ally remains unInfected, but any other result means they are Immediately Infected. When this happens, the Ally will succumb to the Contagion’s Effects with much quicker results than the Survivors. Immediately upon becoming infected, you should draw a single card. If the card is a number, then the Ally will automatically cross the Threshold sometime in the next scene. If the card is a face or ace, the Threshold is crossed sometime in the *current* scene.

Should an Ally Turn, the new Threat must be purchased into the scene just liked Turned Threats (detailed above). Their previous Ally Rank (if any remains) is added to their new Threat score.

> **Example**: In a previous example, Splick narrated that Max Benton’s ally Policeman Joe sacrificed himself to save Max from some monsters. However, Splick was not aware that in this scenario, anyone who dies comes back as a zombie, regardless of infecting bites and such. When Joe bites the bullet, Screg secretly draws a card, getting a Queen of Clubs! He narrates Joe’s valiant death, and Splick continues to have Max explore the scene. But a few minutes later, Screg interrupts some question Splick is asking to tell him that Max suddenly feels something grab his leg with a grip from beyond the grave. It’s Policeman Joe! Screg pays two Adversity tokens to purchase Joe as a Hindrance, and draws a card (seven of Spades) for Joe’s new Threat score. Since Joe and Max had started to develop something of a survivors’ friendship, Screg pays an Adversity token to make this a Panic Button event for Max, giving him a point of CGP.

##### Turned Survivors

Like Threats, player-controlled characters can become Turned, too. When the Survivor turns, she becomes a CiC-controlled Threat with a Threat score equal to her Threat tally at the time of Turning, plus any remaining Characteristic ranks they may have had at that moment. Remember that Threat tally you’ve been counting since the game began? That’s the one. The longer a character has survived, the more badass she will be when she becomes a zombie. Total the Threat and Characteristics and the result is the new Threat score for the character.

Unlike turned Threats, turned Survivors under the control of the CiC ***do not*** need to be purchased into the scene. However, you can choose to spend Adversity to boost their Threat scores using the normal rules for doing so. They automatically come into the game as Minibosses, getting four-card hands for use in Showdowns. Once they’ve Turned, you can bring them into play at any time during any scene without needing to pay any Adversity tokens. You can do this as often as you like, up until the turned Survivor is somehow eliminated.

Of course, if the CiC allows it, the players whose Survivors have turned can choose to continue playing as their turned characters, or can instead opt to stat up new characters and bring them into play. Playing Turned characters can be quite fun, and can lead to zombie-driven games of exciting inter-player conflict. Framing new scenes around this can be difficult, though. If one or two characters have Turned and their players opt to keep on playing, consider framing scenes around them, and have the other players temporarily take over other in-game characters that are either fighting against or running away from these player-cannibals.

Adversity Cost**: None!**

**Starting Threat**: Equal to the Threat Score of the character at the time of their Turning, plus the total remaining Ranks in their Characteristics.

Showdown Hand Size**: Four cards**

### Sample Contagions

Below are a few examples of Contagions created using the five basic variables described above. These are all based on famous zombie movies and media, and are perfect for any game of Cannibal Contagion. I encourage you to try each of them out in your own various game sessions. Each of these example Contagions is described with the five base variables, as well as a little flavorful background that you can use in your games.

#### The Infectious Infestation

Alien Parasites! These vile critters use your body as an incubator, and then burst into the world as dangerous infant monsters bent on devouring all life. Usually, their birth involves your violent, bloody, painful death.

*Inspirations:* Alien, Iron Empires, Resident Evil 4, Slither

**Vector**: Physical. The Parasites must be implanted into the victim’s body by direct physical action. This most commonly involves a physical Showdown, with the alien directly penetrating the flesh of the intended host with some kind of proboscis or other egg-laying appendage. Burrowing and drilling worms are popular alternate versions of this, as are mad scientists with needles.

**Effects**: Incubating. Once the character is infected, the parasites steadily grow until they eventually explode from the host body.

**Threshold**: Threat Cap. As the parasites grow, the Infection tally increases. Once it exceeds the character’s Threat, the beautiful slimy alien is born.

**Aftermath**: Turned (Parasitic Evolution). Once the Threshold is crossed, an alien monster enters the game, clawing its way out of the character’s body. The monster’s Threat is equal to the character’s at the time the Threshold was crossed plus any remaining Characteristic ranks, and has whatever other stats the CiC desires.

**Antidote**: There are these special pills you can take to slow the growth, but they only delay the inevitable. Otherwise, you gotta Destroy the Source: the Hive Queen, mothership, pastamancer, or other such entity. These latter suggestions will most likely act as MacGuffins.

#### The Maddening Murderness

The Murderness is a vile disease which drives those infected by it to and beyond the brink of violent insanity. As the infection sets in, the character grows steadily more erratic and psychotic, until eventually they are overwhelmed by their madness and can do nothing else but cause violence and suffering to everyone they see.

*Inspirations:* 28 Days Later, Black Gas, The Signal

**Vector**: Physical. The Murderness is usually contracted by direct blood or saliva transfer from an infected person. In some scenarios, it might be carried by toxic fumes or gaseous clouds.

**Effects**: Definitely a Maddening Contagion, and if you want the players to Turn quickly, make it Incubating (using CGP instead of Infection tallies) as well.

**Threshold**: Madness. The moment a character enters Stage 5 on the CGP meter after becoming infected with the Murderness, they’ve Turned.

**Aftermath**: Turned (Psycho Killer!) Folks who have been Turned by the Murderness go on a rampage, filled with an insatiable lust for violence and nothing but. They will be unable to do anything but stalk and kill. They will not tire, they will not bathe, they will not talk or laugh; violence is their only action. Eventually their bodies will expire from lack of nourishment, but they’ve got a good month or so before that happens…

**Antidote**: Rumor has it that a *complete* blood transfusion of the infected victim will cure the Murderness, but c’mon, who really believes that?

#### The Shambling Sickness

When there’s no more room in hell, the dead shall walk the earth, and this is the Contagion you should use to play that out. If you’ve seen the George Romero movies, then you know everything there is to know about surviving this Contagion: run away, don’t get bitten, and don’t let yourself die. Sooner or later everyone comes back, but those painful zombie bites sure help to speed the process along!

*Inspirations:* Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, Planet Terror, Versus

**Vector**: The Contagion technically has two Vectors. The base vector is “No Reason” – meaning that *anyone* who dies will come back, regardless of infection. The second vector, however, is Physical: those bitten by the dead get sick and die a whole lot quicker. The rest of these variables are written from the perspective of the Contagion being transmitted by that bite.

**Effects**: Debilitating. Once bitten, your body deteriorates and you slowly die. For some reason, the zombie bites cause festering wounds that bring your death about pretty quickly. Is this because of a virus, or some supernatural contagion?

**Threshold**: Death. Once the character dies, regardless of infection, the Aftermath sets in. The only difference here, Infection-wise, is that people who have been bitten reach that death a whole lot sooner.

**Aftermath**: Turned (Undeath). The character returns to the game as a flesh-eating zombie! They retain no semblance of their original self, and no form of communication other than a chilling moan. Their only goal is to eat you!

**Antidote**: None, nor is there any real explanation – there doesn’t really need to be. I encourage you to not try and explain the zombies. Just throw them in, and let the players do what they can to survive. Let them try and find a cure that doesn’t exist, let them try to make sense of the unexplainable.

## Game Over, Man

Did you all die? No worries, just curious...

Every story has an end, as does every game of ***CC***. Sometimes the end will come when the characters defeat a final boss, or destroy the source of the Contagion. In other games, the game will end when they’re killed by the monsters – or by the hands of their friends, even. Sometimes, a game might even end with a good solid cliffhanger, which is my personal favorite way to end any game in which I am a player or a CiC.

A typical session of ***Cannibal Contagion*** tends to last from four to ten scenes in length. When it comes time to bring the game to a close, just resolve the last scene and let things end. There’s really no need for any post-game awards, unless your group has their own system for things like that. Let the players enjoy the story that they helped bring to a close, and then go out with them afterwards and talk about it over beer and chicken wings. Find out what everyone liked, what anyone disliked, and learn ways to make your next games even more awesome than your last.

### Extended Play

***CC*** is primarily intended as a “pick-up” game, best used for short-run, one-or-two-shot gaming sessions. The scope of the game is fairly limited, focused almost entirely on immediate survival. However, some groups may find that the stories they start telling in one session are just too good to let go after only a single sitting. Some groups may want to explore those stories much more deeply by picking them up in additional follow-up sessions.

Setting up a follow-up session of ***CC*** is actually a lot easier than creating the first session, as the scenario preparation and character creation is already take care of. Just sit back down, whip those characters back out onto the gaming table, grab your cards and start playing. You can pick up right where you left off, or you might enjoy jumping ahead in time a bit and picking up sometime after the previous game’s events.

Players experienced with other published role-playing games will be familiar with the concept of Character Advancement, wherein characters in those games receive “experience points” and use them to acquire new abilities and such. ***CC*** doesn’t really have that option, as by default the system is pretty skewed against the characters’ survival – if a character makes it to the end of the session, that’s usually reward enough! While the Survival token system is intended to allow characters to heal and “recharge” their stuff between scenes, the system isn’t entirely designed for long-term campaign-style play. However, should particularly well-played characters survive a session of ***CC*** and wish to continue in a follow-up session, the CiC may wish to award them with some sort of character bonus.

Probably the easiest character bonus would come in the form of increases to the characters’ Characteristic Scores. Consider allowing each player to increase the maximum rank of any one of their four Characteristics by one or more points, making them a lot more badass come next session.

## CiC Tips

As with the Characters section, here I’ve compiled some various bits of advice that I think could be useful to CiCs new to the system, based on things I’ve noticed in my own games.

* When the players finish Showdowns, take note of their highest-played card, so you can compare it with their current Juice, and keep track of when they run out.
* It helps to have a few scene ideas prepped in advance. This keeps the game flowing fast and action-packed.
* Don’t hold back with the Adversity tokens, unless you’re planning something big. It really pays off to throw everything you have at the players.
* If you’re running out of ideas, keep the draw tables from the back of this book close by. They can help immensely with pulling random characters and encounters out of thin air.


# The Zombie Apocalypse is Now

This section of the rules contains a demo scenario for you to use to get your players into the action of ***Cannibal Contagion***. This is the original demo I frequently run at playtests and pick-up games, and I’ve found that it really works well for some high-octane zombie-killing fun. There are four complete scenes here for you to run, and more than a handful of suggestions for scenes to run as follow-ups. Read over the background and basic scenario setup information, and pass out the four pregenerated stock characters from the Survivors section of this book.

## Welcome to the End of Days!

**Setting and Premise:** *“And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder: One of the four beasts saying: “Come and see.” And I saw.”* This is the core, default scenario for ***Cannibal Contagion***. In this scenario, Doomsday has arrived, and its royal litter is being carried by waves of zombies. The characters are a collection of unconnected strangers who have been forced together, trying to survive and find safe shelter against the cannibals that now run wild on the streets.

**Contagion:** A variant of the Shambling Sickness or the Maddening Murderness works best with this scenario. This specific introductory game does not need to go into the details of the Contagion’s nature or origin, as the primary focus is staying alive and not getting infected. If you want to jump right in, just use the default Shambling Sickness outlined below:

* **Vector:** Physical (bites) 
* **Effects:** Debilitating 
* **Threshold:** Death 
* **Aftermath:** Turned (Undeath) 
* **Antidote:** None, no explanation

**Primary Threat:** This should be pretty clear, but in case you weren’t listening: Zombies. Hell isn’t necessarily out of room just yet, but that doesn’t matter, as for whatever reason the dead ain’t staying dead in this crazy-go-nuts world gone mad. Everything was fine and peachy, and then one day some mysterious infection starts spreading, and all hell breaks loose. A scene or two into the game and the streets are overrun with infected flesh-eating corpses which move slowly but never stop moving. These were once people – your friends, your classmates, your co-workers – and now they are The Enemy.

**Characters:** The four stock characters from the Survivors section of the rules should be well-suited for playing this scenario, and if you have more players, feel free to create some extra characters in advance. If this is the first time your players have played, I suggest just assigning them pre-generated characters and skipping the creation section, instead jumping right into play after a brief explanation of the basic game mechanics.

**Threat Factor:** Doomsday! When the game begins, the crap is just now in the process of hitting the fan, and the infection will spread like wildfire. Rack up those Adversity tokens and take out all your aggressions on those poor, doomed Survivors.

**Game Setup:** Make sure you’ve got some pencils and note paper, and I suggest printing out copies of the character sheets, either by photocopying the sheet in this book or by printing the sheets that you can download from the game’s website (http://cannibalcontagion.com). Set these up in a spot with comfortable seating and nearby writing surfaces, such as at a convention table, in the dining room, or around your living room coffee table. Get yoruself some drinks and snacks to set close at hand, and maybe set some suspenseful or creepy mood music playing in the background.

## Cold Openers

The following Cold Openers can be played if you’re using the sample characters from this book. If not, then be sure to ask each player The Question you come up with and then play through a tailor-made Cold Opener for their character. Try to steer the direction of that scene so they can each begin on the bus in the First Scene written up further below.

**Carla** is waiting tables at a crappy midtown restaurant when a customer tries to get a little fresh with her. Wait a sec, that’s more than fresh – that’s rotting flesh! After dealing with the customer and a couple more that shamble in, she goes out the back and sees the Citybus pulling up right then! Maybe she can make it home quickly to check on her kids…

**Roger** is in his car, driving home from work, yapping on his cell phone when he hears a scream on the other end, and it cuts off, no reception. He pulls off the road to dig for his “emergency” backup phone, when a zombie bursts through his window! He hits the gas in panic, crashes, and now must deal with this shambler trapped in the car with him. When done, he sees a sign for the bus station, and sees hope for getting out of here.

**Jian** is riding his cruiser fast and hard through the rain-slicked streets. A pretty dame with a nice rack catches his eye momentarily, and when he returns his eyes to the road, he swerves just in time to not hit someone in the middle of the road. He is thrown off his bike, which crashes and totals against a building. When he gets up, he sees the person coming closer. She’s a zombie, kill her! When done, he sees a large mass of them further down the street, coming closer! Right then a city bus pulls up.

**Mei Li** and her friends are at recess at their super-expensive private school. A rival gang of girls comes up and harasses them, but they look a little sick. A fight breaks out, and during the fight, the girls start biting each other! Her friends start bleeding and dying, so Mei Li must defeat the zombie schoolgirls and get away, as it looks like the whole school is now going crazy. She runs and just barely manages to catch up with the bus that is pulling away on the next corner.

## First Scene: The Crash

The characters are all in the same vicinity, sitting near the back of a bus (city or fleet) that just ramped and crash-landed on its side. There are others on the bus too, some okay, most injured, some dead. The characters did not see why the bus crashed, only that everything started going crazy and soon the world was literally right flipped upside-down. Soon, folks start screaming near the front, and there’s inhuman groaning and the sounds of violence. What do you do?

**When/Where:** During the afternoon rush hour commute, somewhere in or near the downtown area, most likely in your own city.

**Explosion!:** This scene should open with the bus hitting a car pile-up and ramping up sideways into the air. In a second or two the bus will crash down sideways, throwing the passengers all around inside and showering them with broken glass. Describe the scene as total chaos, everyone is screaming, a briefcase flies through the air and smashes into the face of the fellow sitting next to you, a wheelchair-bound rider is thrown atop several others, and so on. As the bus is in the air, have each character make a Cool Quickie. Anyone who succeeds can think quickly enough to take a quick action as the bus is in the air.

**Scene Purpose:** To introduce the characters to each other and to the situation. Their goal for the scene should be to get off the bus quickly and safely. If they wish to help others, they should be rewarded.

##### Conflicts

**The Bodies:** Get out from under a pile of bodies, some alive, some dead.

**The Bus:** Escape the Bus – obvious escape routes would be the jagged windows above, or one of the two exits – most city busses have a front and back door, while most fleet busses have a back exit in the roof. If they try the back exit, it is twisted and jammed, possibly even covered by “debris” from some outside wreckage.

**The Zombies:** If the players spend too much time looking for a way out, and aren’t thinking fast or working together, use your starting Adversity to throw some zombies at them. There’s some violence going down in the front, and it is steadily moving toward the characters at the back of the bus.

**The Other Survivors:** There are survivors, but not many. To determine how many folks survived, draw two cards and keep the highest, and the lower of the two determines how many of those survivors are injured. Draw another card to determine how many are dead. Do the players try and help them?

**Bonus Opportunities:** Whichever character takes the first action towards selflessly helping other non-player survivors immediately earns a Survival token. If that player is taking indirect action by coordinating some kind of group escape plan for more than one survivor, they get two. After the scene is over, add a token to the team’s Survival Pool for every two survivors the players helped escape.

**Added Oomph:** Want to really shake things up? Have another survivor escape before the Survivors. When they follow him out of the wreckage, they see him gunned down by a line of advancing riot cops, who are apparently shooting anything that moves. What do you do now, fellas?

**End of Scene:** This scene should end once the Survivors have escaped from the bus and come up with at least a bare minimum of a plan for what to do next.

##### Possible Follow-up Scenes

* They’ve been taken to a shelter by the cops, but the shelter’s safety has just been compromised by an infected refugee!
* New scene opens with the Survivors in an alley facing off against advancing riot cops. The catch? These are *zombie* cops, with full riot gear. Watch out!

## Scene: Riot at McGurdy’s Hardware

The characters need some gear, and fast! They venture into the city to McGurdy’s Hardware, only to find that a lot of other folks have the same idea.

**When/Where:** Shortly after the Contagion begins to take over the city, in front of a locally-owned hardware warehouse superstore. It’s about a third the size of your typical Home Depot.

**Explosion!:** The scene opens with the sound of a riot in the making. Hundreds of other survivors have taken to the streets, and a good number of them are looting the stores and strip malls in the area. There’s even a small mod gathered outside the Hardware store, and the sounds of screams and gunfire in the distance.

**Scene Purpose:** The Survivors need some Gear, and the hardware store was the first place that came to mind. If they do well in this scene, the spoils of the store are theirs for the taking.

##### Conflicts

**The Crowd:** The folks trying to break in will definitely be a Threat of some sort. The Survivors can try and just tag along and see what happens, challenge them for looting rights, or deal with them once inside. Showdowns against the crowd don’t have to all be violent, mind you, as some good moments of negotiation and “Let us fight together, folks!” speeches can be quite fun. Both **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** and **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cool</span>** can be very useful in these situations.

**The Store:** Getting into the store itself will require some ingenuity. The front is made of heavy-duty glass, so trying to shatter the windows won’t be all that useful. Let the players come up with a good way to get in on their own.

**The Looting:** Once the Survivors get in, they have to deal with other looters. There could be Showdowns with other people over who gets what loot, and quite possibly some bloke might try and “take over” as a warlord, using this as his fortress. Have the players make **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** checks when they’re looking for specific gear.

**The Chainsaw Zombies:** C’mon, you knew these guys were coming. These fells are at least Miniboss rank, and carry chainsaws. They will scream and howl and pursue the Survivors relentlessly until somehow destroyed. For some reason, someone tied burlap sacks around their heads, probably so the Survivors wouldn’t have to see their hideous faces.

**Bonus Opportunities:** If the Survivors actually try and coordinate the looting efforts with the other folks there, give them a bonus Survival token, and another if they succeed. If they try to actually *take over* and become the new “lords” of this situation, give them two each, and another if they succeed. Any number of good Allies can be made from this scene.

**Added Oomph:** If you really want to mess with them, have the place already be looted! Each attempt to find new loot would then be a Royal Pain, or even a Longshot. You could also throw in that one or more of the looters is infected already, and turns while in the middle of looting.

**End of Scene:** This scene should end when the characters stock up on Gear, leave empty-handed, or establish some kind of lordly domain. Any of these would make a good ending point. If the players come up with something better, of course, just go with it.

##### Possible Follow-up Scenes

* The Survivors have led their new followers into a suburb just outside of the city, and are about to go to war with another army in front of a high school, medieval-style!
* The Survivors are now trapped on the roof of the Hardware store. See, all the looters got infected and the zombies ran wild, so they ran to the roof and barricaded the stairs behind them with lumber and power tools. Now what?

## Scene: Something Afoul in the Sewers

The Survivors have found temporary shelter in the sewers beneath the city, but deep in the darkness beyond, something sinister awaits them… something *hungry*…

**When/Where:** This scene takes place in the cramped sewers beneath the city. The passages are cramped and labyrinthine, and the Survivors must forge their way through the offal and muck to find their way wherever it is they are going.

**Explosion!:** The characters are scrambling down a ladder shaft from the streets above, and the last one is thrown halfway down the shaft as a massive explosion above rocks the earth. The character drops and rolls aside, and chunks of ceiling, brick, and pavement fall as the shaft collapses, sealing the entrance to the sewer behind them. Looks like they’re going to have to find another way out!

**Scene Purpose:** Seeking an emergency escape from a horde above, the Survivors have trapped themselves in the sewers and most now find their way out. Maybe one of them knows a secret hideout, or maybe they’re just running madly until they find another safe exit. This scene would be great for building up some creepy tension, as who knows what horrors lurk in the dark?

##### Conflicts

**Getting Lost:** Getting lost in the foul darkness of the sewers is a constant threat. As the characters wander the veritable maze of waste, they can very easily get lost in the oppressive black. Periodically have one or more of them make **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Savvy</span>** checks, with failures resulting in them getting lost. If they have some kind of Gear that provides light, or some kind of mapping tools, then they can use them for bonus draws. This is a great opportunity to work out that Panic Button.

**Disease and Sickness:** Sickness is another major danger, as the Survivors are literally walking in or very close to the bodily wastes of all the people of the city. Additionally, any number of other disgusting things are in the muck too, from dirty needles to diseased rats and more. Feel free to periodically have them startled by a creature running up their pants legs, or freak them out when the step on something sharp. Use an Adversity token to force a character to make a **<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grit</span>** quickie, and if they fail, make him resist a point of Hurtin’.

**Escape:** How are they going to get out of the sewers? They might stumble upon an underground waterway, or find the railway mentioned above, or bust into their city’s Subway tunnels, or just keep trying the various access shafts until they find one they can open. Give them the tiniest hints, but ultimately let them try and come up with ideas on their own.

**Monsters:** The scene just wouldn’t be complete without a bunch of monsters, now, would it? Have the Survivors bust through a barricaded door looking for supplies or other surviving people, only to find the room on the other side full of zombies, who turned after they barricaded themselves in. Or have them encounter some twisted gator-rat-men feasting upon the corpses of some sewer workers, only to attack the Survivors when their meal is interrupted.

**Bonus Opportunities:** Give the players the slightest hint of something more by mentioning an old, long-disused access tunnel off to the side, possibly built long before the sewers were fully established. There’s a creepy guttural clicking noise that echoes from down the passage. The passage is held up with rotten beams and looks like it could collapse at any moment. If the players brave the potential collapse and defeat the Miniboss-grade Threat at the end, they discover an old cache of *mostly* rotted weapons from the 1890s “Shanghai” days, and a single set of mine-cart-like rails that could lead them to the waterfront/riverside/railyard/what-have-you. Award the bravest among them a Survival token or two. Any player who suggests a *Temple of Doom*-style mine cart chase is my hero and gets *two* bonus tokens.

**Added Oomph:** You should *seriously* play up the ambience of the all-pervasive darkness that surrounds their every step. Make it seem alive, and to help, throw in descriptions of half-seen movements in the shadows, accompanied by skitterings, slithering, crunching, and moans in the distant dark which seem to be getting ever so slowly closer… and *multiplying*. Hit those Panic Buttons!

**End of Scene:** This scene should end when the Survivors have found a way to escape the sewers.

##### Possible Follow-up Scenes

* Having broken through to the Subway tunnels, a new scene has them battle through a mass of commuter undead to get to the front of their train and hit the brakes before it crashes!
* The Survivors have been taken in by a strange underground cult of mutants and nutjobs. They must escape, take them down, or somehow use them to their advantage.

## Scene: The Airfield Escape

They’ve made it across town to a small private airfield, and now they only need to get a plane started and high-tail it out of there!

**When/Where:** A private airfield in the county outside of town. There is a small set of hangars which, once broken into, will reveal four fully-functional small planes. There’s also an attached office, and a lot of gear around. There’s also a plume of smoke off in the distance which, if investigated, will reveal the site of a crashed military cargo transport helicopter.

**Explosion!:** Almost out of gas, the Survivors hit the gas and ram their stolen jeep through the wire fence that surrounds the airfield. The jeep runs out of gas just a hundred yards or so from the hangars.

**Scene Purpose:** To give the Survivors hope that they just might escape this crazy city.

##### Conflicts

**The Fuel Crisis:** There are four planes there, but only one of them can carry all of the Survivors and whatever Allies they’ve brought with them. Additionally, it’s almost out of fuel. The most fueled one is a single-person stunt plane, and the other two planes have some fuel too. If they search around a while, they can find some more fuel reserves. However, getting all the fuel into the larger plane could take some time, especially if they resort to siphoning it. Meanwhile, the zombies are coming. Of course, a selfish player could just take the already-fueled plane, and sucks to the rest of them! Award this selfish player a bonus token!

**Starting the Plane:** Once they get the plane fueled, how will they start it, and who will fly it? Gotta find the keys or otherwise hotwire it. After that, who among the Survivors is able to pilot?

**Zombies:** First off, a handful of typical shamblers are inside the hangar, including a pilot or two and some students. With the fence ruptured, of course, more from outside will start coming in, and must be dealt with.

**The Mincer:** Bad news for the Survivors: that crashed military chopper was carrying an experimental war creature, called The Mincer! This human-monster-hybrid-thing was created using the Contagion as a potential weapon, and was in transit to a hidden base when it escaped its bonds. The chopper crashed, but it escaped, and will attack the Survivors before they can take off. The Mincer is a Big Bad, and should have all manner of foul bio-organic weapons.

**Bonus Opportunities:** Any player who tries to use the plane’s propeller blades to chop up The Mincer can treat it as a +6 Hurtin’ weapon, no Juice cost, no Draw bonus. Additionally, give them a Survival token for such a bad ass idea.

**Added Oomph:** If you want to make the fight with The Mincer really difficult, give him any of the qualities described in the sample Threat section (starting on page 142). He could be a regenerator, a threatener, or worse. Since this is probably their first encounter with a Big Bad, make them fight hard!

**End of Scene:** This scene should end when the players either fly away or otherwise escape from the airfield.

##### Possible Follow-up Scenes

* Their plane has crashed just south of the border, and they must now deal with foreign zombie variants and crazed post-apocalypse doom bikers.
* Twenty years later, the children of these survivors ride camels to the entrance of a monster-infested desert temple, to find the source of the problem and end it once and for all. 
* How about something totally off-the-chain: a battle in the sky versus zombie-piloted fighter planes!

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have now just run your first session of ***Cannibal Contagion***! Awesome! I hope everything turned out well, and I hope everyone had a whole lot of fun.

Wrapping up the session should be pretty simple. As you clean up the tokens and other supplies, ask your players what they thought about the experience (if it was their first time). You can learn a lot from these player comments, and they can help you make your games even more fun in the future.

So what’s next? If you had fun, I suggest trying another scenario of your own some time, possibly basing it off any of the sample scenario ideas provided in the CiC section of these rules. If the players had such fun that they want to continue on with these characters, then just plan a new scenario starting where you left off, and give it a whirl when you next meet.
